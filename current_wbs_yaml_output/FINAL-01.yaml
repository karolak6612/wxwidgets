definition_of_done: The application uses `QSettings` to save and load all user preferences to a platform-appropriate location. The Preferences dialog (`QDialog`) successfully modifies these settings.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Refactor the `Settings` class to use `QSettings` as its backend instead of `wxConfig`. Port the `PreferencesWindow` to a `QDialog`, connecting all widgets to `QSettings` read/write calls.
