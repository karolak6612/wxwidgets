title: Finalize All Tool Implementations
input_files:
- editor.cpp
dependencies:
- LOGIC-08
definition_of_done: All remaining tools not explicitly covered, such as "Fill" and the full suite of "Map Cleanup" operations, are fully functional and accessible through the main menu.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Port the logic for each remaining tool from `editor.cpp` and `main_menubar.cpp`. Implement each tool's functionality as a method in `EditorController`. Connect the corresponding `QAction` from the main menu to a slot that invokes the controller method.
