definition_of_done: The identified rendering bottlenecks are addressed. This may include implementing more advanced culling (frustum, occlusion), optimizing shader code, and refining the texture atlas management strategy to reduce state changes.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Based on the profiling report, optimize the `MapView::paintGL` method. Implement chunk-based frustum culling to avoid iterating over off-screen map areas. If fill-rate is an issue, batch sprite rendering into as few draw calls as possible.
