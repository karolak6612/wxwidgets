# UI Implementation Status Report

This report provides a detailed assessment of the current status of the UI implementation for the RME-Qt6 migration project, highlighting which parts are completed and which still need work.

## Part 1: Resource Path Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

### ResourcePathManager
- ✅ Created and implemented in `src/core/utils/ResourcePathManager.h` and `.cpp`
- ✅ Provides centralized resource path resolution
- ✅ Includes fallback mechanisms for missing resources
- ✅ Properly initialized in main.cpp

### MainWindow Resource Paths
- ✅ Uses ResourcePathManager to load menubar.xml
- ✅ Implements multiple fallback paths if the primary path fails
- ✅ Provides detailed logging for resource loading attempts

### BrushMaterialEditorDialog Resource Paths
- ✅ Uses ResourcePathManager for XML file paths
- ✅ Implements proper error handling for missing files
- ✅ Includes fallback to Qt resources and application data paths

### Resources.qrc
- ✅ Includes all required resources:
  - ✅ menubar.xml
  - ✅ XML files for brush materials (borders.xml, grounds.xml, etc.)
  - ✅ Palette XML files
  - ✅ Other required resources (items.otb, Tibia.otfi, etc.)

## Part 2: Core Data Integration - COMPLETED ✅

### MinimapViewWidget Integration
- ✅ Uses actual map data instead of placeholders
- ✅ Implements proper scaling calculations based on map size
- ✅ Correctly implements widgetToMapCoords() with actual map coordinates
- ✅ Uses ItemDatabase for item colors in the minimap

### Property Dialogs Integration
- **ItemPropertiesDialog**:
  - ✅ Basic structure is implemented
  - ✅ Connects to core data structures (Map, Tile, Item)
  - ✅ Added getItemData method to IItemTypeProvider interface
  - ✅ Implemented type-specific controls based on item type
  - ✅ Fixed property loading and saving
  - ✅ Improved validation for input fields

- **CreaturePropertiesDialog**:
  - ✅ Basic structure is implemented
  - ✅ Connects to core data structures (Creature)
  - ✅ Properly loads and saves creature data
  - ✅ Has validation for input fields

- **SpawnPropertiesDialog**:
  - ✅ Basic structure is implemented
  - ✅ Connects to core data structures (SpawnData)
  - ✅ Properly loads and saves spawn data
  - ✅ Has validation for input fields

### Brush Material Editor XML Integration
- ✅ Basic UI structure is implemented
- ✅ Uses ResourcePathManager for XML file paths
- ✅ Has validation for all brush types
- ✅ XML saving functionality is complete:
  - ✅ Fixed duplicate saveBorderToXml() implementation
  - ✅ Implemented proper XML saving for all brush types
  - ✅ Added proper XML loading functionality for all brush types
- ✅ Integrated with ItemDatabase for item selection and display
- ✅ Added loading of existing brushes from XML files

## Part 3: Placeholder Services Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

### EditorStateService
- ✅ Implemented in `src/core/editor/EditorStateService.h` and `.cpp`
- ✅ Tracks and provides information about editor state (map, floor, position, etc.)
- ✅ Emits signals when values change
- ✅ Connected to UI components

### BrushStateService
- ✅ Implemented in `src/core/brush/BrushStateService.h` and `.cpp`
- ✅ Tracks and provides information about brush state (type, shape, size, etc.)
- ✅ Emits signals when values change
- ✅ Connected to BrushManagerService

### ItemManager Integration
- ✅ ItemFinderDialogQt takes ItemDatabase as a parameter
- ✅ MinimapViewWidget uses ItemDatabase for item colors
- ✅ BrushMaterialEditorDialog now properly integrates with ItemDatabase
- ✅ Components use ItemDatabase for item information

## Part 4: Integration Gaps - PARTIALLY COMPLETED ⚠️

### MainWindow Integration
- ✅ Main structure is implemented
- ✅ Uses ResourcePathManager to load menubar.xml
- ✅ Has fallback mechanisms for resource loading
- ✅ Implements all required menu actions
- ✅ Connects to EditorController and BrushIntegrationManager
- ✅ Manages editor tabs properly
- ✅ Saves and loads window settings

### DockManager Integration
- ✅ Basic structure is implemented
- ✅ Creates and manages dock panels
- ✅ Saves and loads dock layout
- ✅ Updates menu actions based on dock visibility
- ⚠️ Some palette panels are not fully implemented:
  - HousePalettePanel (commented out in createHousePalette())
  - WaypointPalettePanel (commented out in createWaypointPalette())
  - PropertiesPanel (commented out in createPropertiesPanel())
  - MinimapPanel (commented out in createMinimapPanel())
