definition_of_done: The Undo/Redo (`ActionQueue`), `Selection`, and `CopyBuffer` systems are ported to `mapcore`. All logic is decoupled from UI events and operates on core data models. `wxThread` is replaced by `std::thread`.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Port the `Action`, `ActionQueue`, `Selection`, and `CopyBuffer` classes. Rewrite `SelectionThread` using `std::thread`. These classes must compile within `mapcore` without any UI framework includes.
