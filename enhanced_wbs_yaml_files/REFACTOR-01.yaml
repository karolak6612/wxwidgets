This class acts as a central hub for managing the entire application's UI state and providing access to shared resources and services. Key responsibilities include: managing the active editor instance and its state (current map, floor, zoom), brush selection and parameters (`current_brush`, `brush_size`, etc.), editor mode (drawing/selection), palette and minimap instances and their visibility, the copy/paste buffer, loaded client version data, OpenGL context, and various UI helper functions like showing dialogs, progress bars, and updating the main frame's title and status bar.

    description: "This task addresses the architectural decision made in UI-03 where a 'GuiManager' singleton was planned as a Qt replacement for g_gui. This WBS item (REFACTOR-01) aims to refactor that concept further by breaking down the monolithic GuiManager into smaller, focused services that are provided via dependency injection instead of global singleton access."
current_functionality_summary: |
  The wxWidgets application relied heavily on a global `g_gui` object (class `GUI`) to manage almost all UI-related state and provide access to shared services. This included:
  - **Editor Session Management:** Knowing the current `Editor` instance, current `Map`, active `MapCanvas`, floor, zoom level.
  - **Brush Management:** Storing the currently selected `Brush`, its size, shape, variation, and specific brush instances (e.g., `eraser`, `house_brush`). Managing the `doodad_buffer_map`.
  - **Editor Mode:** Current mode (drawing, selection, pasting).
  - **Data Management:** Loading and providing access to client version data (`ClientVersion`, `SpriteManager` via `gfx`, `ItemManager` via `g_items`, `MaterialManager` via `g_materials`).
  - **UI Element Management:** Managing palettes (`PaletteWindow`), minimap (`MinimapWindow`), search results window, progress bars, and the main application frame (`MainFrame`). Handling AUI perspective.
  - **User Interaction:** Displaying dialogs, managing hotkeys, updating status bar and window title.
  - **Clipboard:** Providing access to the `CopyBuffer`.
  - **OpenGL Context:** Managing the shared `wxGLContext`.
  The conceptual `GuiManager` singleton (planned in `UI-03`) was intended to carry these responsibilities over to the Qt version. This refactoring task aims to break down this centralized global/singleton approach.
refactoring_suggestions: |
  The primary refactoring is the core of this task: replacing the global `g_gui` (and its conceptual successor, the `GuiManager` singleton) with multiple, focused service classes provided through dependency injection.
  Key service classes to create could include:
  - `BrushManager`: Handles active brush, brush properties (size, shape, variation), and specific brush data.
  - `EditorStateManager` (or `ApplicationStateManager`): Manages current editor mode, active floor, potentially active `EditorSession` if multiple maps can be open.
  - `PaletteService`: Manages creation, registration, and state of different palettes.
  - `DialogService`: Provides a consistent way to show application-specific dialogs.
  - `ClientVersionService`: Manages the currently loaded client version and provides access to its data (items, sprites, materials). This would encapsulate `g_items`, `g_creatures`, `g_materials`, and `gfx` access.
  - `ClipboardService`: Wraps `CopyBuffer` functionality.
  - `OpenGLContextManager` (if complex sharing is needed beyond QOpenGLWidget's capabilities, though likely not necessary).
  - `SettingsService`: Provides typed access to application settings, replacing direct `g_settings` calls for UI-related configurations.
qt6_migration_steps:
  - "**1. Identify `g_gui` Responsibilities:**"
    - Exhaustively list all states managed and services provided by the original `wxwidgets/gui.h/cpp` (as detailed in `current_functionality_summary`). This list forms the requirements for the new service classes.
  - "**2. Design Focused Service Classes:**"
    - Based on the identified responsibilities, define a set of new service classes. Examples:
        - `BrushStateService` (or `BrushManager`): Manages active brush, its type, size, shape, variation, and any brush-specific data (e.g., current raw item ID, current creature type). Emits signals when brush or settings change.
        - `EditorStateService` (or `ApplicationStateManager`): Manages current editor mode (draw, select, fill), active map document/editor session, current floor, current zoom (if not solely per-view). Emits signals on state changes.
        - `ClientDataService`: Manages the loaded `ClientVersion` and provides access to items (`ItemManager`), sprites (`SpriteManager`), materials (`MaterialManager`), and creatures (`CreatureManager`). This replaces direct access to `g_items`, `g_gui.gfx`, `g_materials`, `g_creatures`.
        - `UIService` (or `WindowManager`/`DialogManager`): Handles requests to show standard dialogs (open, save, message boxes), manages floating tool windows or palettes if not handled by `QMainWindow`'s docking.
        - `ClipboardManager`: Manages `CopyBuffer` functionality.
        - `SettingsManager`: Provides typed access to application settings relevant to UI and editor state.
  - "**3. Instantiate Services in `MainWindow`:**"
    - The `MainWindow` (from `UI-01`) will create and own instances of these new service classes (e.g., `m_brushStateService = new BrushStateService(this);`).
  - "**4. Implement Dependency Injection:**"
    - Modify constructors of classes that need these services to accept them as parameters. For example:
        - `EditorController(mapcore::Map* map, mapcore::ActionQueue* queue, BrushStateService* brushService, EditorStateService* editorStateService, ...)`
        - `MapViewWidget(BrushStateService* brushService, EditorStateService* editorStateService, ...)`
        - Palette UI classes will take `BrushStateService*` and `ClientDataService*`.
        - Toolbars will take `EditorStateService*` and `BrushStateService*`.
    - `MainWindow` will pass the owned service instances when creating these components.
  - "**5. Codebase-Wide Refactoring:**"
    - Remove all usages of the old `g_gui` global object.
    - Replace calls like `g_gui.GetCurrentBrush()` with `m_brushStateService->getActiveBrush()`.
    - Replace `g_gui.GetCurrentEditor()` logic: `EditorStateService` might provide the active `EditorSession`, from which the `EditorController` or `Map` can be accessed.
    - Replace direct access to `g_items`, `g_gui.gfx` with calls to `m_clientDataService->getItemManager()`, `m_clientDataService->getSpriteManager()`, etc.
  - "**6. Utilize Signals and Slots:**"
    - Implement communication between services and UI components using Qt's signal/slot mechanism.
    - E.g., Palettes emit signals when user changes brush settings, `BrushStateService` receives this, updates its state, and emits its own signals that `MapViewWidget` or `EditorController` might be connected to.
  - "**7. Phase out Conceptual `GuiManager`:**"
    - Ensure that the `GuiManager` singleton planned in `UI-03` is not implemented. Instead, this WBS directly implements the fine-grained service classes and dependency injection.
  - "**8. Update `EditorController`:**"
    - `EditorController` will become a primary consumer of many of these services to perform its orchestration tasks, interacting with `mapcore` components based on UI state provided by these services.
definition_of_done:
  - The global `g_gui` object's functionalities are fully decomposed into multiple, focused service classes (e.g., `BrushStateService`, `EditorStateService`, `ClientDataService`, `UIService`, `ClipboardManager`, `SettingsManager`).
  - These new service classes are instantiated and owned by `MainWindow`.
  - All components requiring these services (e.g., `EditorController`, `MapViewWidget`, palettes, toolbars) receive them via dependency injection (constructor or dedicated setters).
  - All global access patterns related to `g_gui` (and the conceptual `GuiManager` singleton from `UI-03`) are eliminated from the Qt codebase.
  - The application is fully functional, using the new service-based architecture.
  - Communication between services and components is primarily managed through Qt's signal/slot mechanism.
  - Modularity and testability are demonstrably improved by the removal of global state dependencies.
estimation_effort:
  - "Very High (35-50 developer days). This is a major architectural refactoring that touches a vast majority of the codebase. Identifying all responsibilities of `g_gui`, designing appropriate service class boundaries, and then updating all call sites across the entire application (UI, controller, potentially core interactions if `g_gui` was improperly used there) is a massive undertaking. Extensive testing will be required to ensure no functionality is broken."

boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: |
  Your task is to refactor the Qt 6 application to eliminate any reliance on a global UI manager object (like the old `g_gui` or the conceptual `GuiManager` singleton from `UI-03`). Replace this with a set of focused service classes owned by `MainWindow` and provided to other components via dependency injection.

  **1. Design and Implement Service Classes:**
     Based on the functionalities of the original `wxwidgets/gui.cpp` (`g_gui`), define and implement the following service classes (place them in a suitable application-level directory like `src/services/`):

     *   **`BrushStateService(QObject* parent)`:**
         -   Manages: `Brush* m_activeBrush`, `BrushShape m_currentShape`, `int m_currentSize`, `int m_brushVariation`, `bool m_drawLockedDoors`, `bool m_useCustomThickness`, `float m_customThicknessMod`, current raw item ID, current creature type for brushes, `BaseMap* m_doodadBufferMap`.
         -   Methods: `setActiveBrush(Brush*)`, `setBrushShape(BrushShape)`, `setBrushSize(int)`, `getActiveBrush()`, `getBrushShape()`, `getBrushSize()`, etc.
         -   Signals: `activeBrushChanged(Brush*)`, `brushSettingsChanged()`.

     *   **`EditorStateService(QObject* parent)`:**
         -   Manages: `EditorMode m_currentMode` (enum for DRAWING_MODE, SELECTION_MODE, etc.), `int m_currentFloor`, `Editor* m_activeEditorSession` (pointer to the currently active editor instance, if applicable for multi-document).
         -   Methods: `setEditorMode(EditorMode)`, `setCurrentFloor(int)`, `setActiveEditorSession(Editor*)`, getters for these.
         -   Signals: `editorModeChanged(EditorMode)`, `currentFloorChanged(int)`, `activeEditorChanged(Editor*)`.

     *   **`ClientDataService(QObject* parent)`:**
         -   Manages: Loaded `ClientVersion* m_clientVersion`, `ItemManager* m_itemManager`, `SpriteManager* m_spriteManager` (for `gfx`), `MaterialManager* m_materialManager`, `CreatureManager* m_creatureManager`.
         -   Methods: `loadVersion(ClientVersionID)`, `unloadVersion()`, `getClientVersion()`, `getItemManager()`, `getSpriteManager()`, etc.
         -   Signals: `clientVersionChanged(ClientVersion*)`.

     *   **`WindowManagerService(QObject* parent)`:** (Replaces `g_gui`'s direct window/dialog management)
         -   Manages: `MainFrame* m_mainWindow` (or `QMainWindow*`), `MapTabbook* m_tabbook`, references to palettes, minimap if they are independent windows/docks.
         -   Methods: `showErrorDialog(QString title, QString text)`, `showInfoDialog(...)`, `getActiveMapCanvas()`, `getCurrentEditor()`, `getCurrentMapTab()`, `refreshPalettes()`, `updateTitle()`, `updateMenubar()`, `updateStatusText(QString)`.
         -   Manages AUI-like perspective loading/saving conceptually (actual docking is `QMainWindow`).

     *   **`ClipboardService(QObject* parent)`:**
         -   Manages: `mapcore::CopyBuffer m_copyBuffer`.
         -   Methods: `copy()`, `cut()`, `paste()`, `canPaste()`. Interacts with `EditorStateService` to get active editor for operations.

     *   **`ApplicationSettingsService(QObject* parent)`:**
         -   Provides typed access to UI-related settings currently managed by `g_settings` but accessed via `g_gui` (e.g., `g_gui.HasDoorLocked()`, `g_gui.IsPasting()`).

  **2. Instantiate Services in `MainWindow`:**
     - In `MainWindow.h`, declare member pointers for these services.
     - In `MainWindow.cpp` constructor, instantiate them (e.g., `m_brushStateService = new BrushStateService(this);`).

  **3. Dependency Injection:**
     - Modify constructors of `EditorController`, `MapViewWidget`, palette widgets, toolbars, and any other relevant classes to accept pointers to the service instances they need.
     - `MainWindow` will pass its owned service instances when creating these components.
     - For example: `m_editorController = new EditorController(m_mapInstance, m_actionQueue, m_selection, m_brushStateService, m_editorStateService, m_clipboardService, ...);`
     - `m_mapViewWidget = new MapViewWidget(m_editorController, m_brushStateService, m_editorStateService, ...);`

  **4. Codebase Refactoring:**
     - Globally replace calls to `g_gui.someMethod()` or `GuiManager::instance()->someMethod()` with calls to the appropriate injected service instance (e.g., `m_brushStateService->getActiveBrush()`).
     - This includes replacing direct access to `g_items`, `g_gui.gfx`, `g_materials`, `g_creatures` with `m_clientDataService->getItemManager()`, etc.
     - Update UI elements (toolbars, menus, palettes) to interact with these services, primarily using signals and slots. For example, a brush palette, when a brush is selected, would call `m_brushStateService->setActiveBrush(newBrush);`. `MapViewWidget` would connect to `m_brushStateService->activeBrushChanged(...)` to update its display.

  **5. Remove Global Singleton:**
     - Delete `GuiManager.h/.cpp` (if it was created based on UI-03) and remove any global instance.
     - Ensure no static `instance()` methods or global pointers to these new services exist.

The analysis of `wxwidgets/gui.h` and `wxwidgets/gui.cpp` is complete. These files detail the extensive responsibilities of the `g_gui` global object.

The WBS for `REFACTOR-01.yaml` has been updated to reflect a strategy of decomposing `g_gui`'s (and its conceptual Qt successor `GuiManager`) functionalities into several focused service classes. These services (`BrushStateService`, `EditorStateService`, `ClientDataService`, `WindowManagerService`, `ClipboardManager`, `ApplicationSettingsService`) will be owned by `MainWindow` and provided to other components via dependency injection.

Key changes made to the YAML:
-   Updated `analyzed_input_files` with more detailed descriptions of `gui.h` and `gui.cpp`, emphasizing the breadth of `g_gui`'s roles.
-   Refined `current_functionality_summary` to list the major categories of state and services managed by `g_gui`.
-   Expanded `qt6_migration_steps` and the `boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt` to specifically name and outline the responsibilities of the new service classes and detail how dependency injection should be implemented.
-   Updated `dependencies` to reflect the wide impact of this refactoring.
-   Ensured `definition_of_done` focuses on the elimination of global access patterns and the successful adoption of dependency injection.

This subtask of refining `REFACTOR-01.yaml` is now complete.The WBS file `enhanced_wbs_yaml_files/REFACTOR-01.yaml` has been updated.
The `analyzed_input_files` descriptions for `wxwidgets/gui.h` and `wxwidgets/gui.cpp` were refined to detail the extensive global state and service management roles of the `g_gui` object.
The `title` was updated to "Decouple UI State and Services from Global Access (Refactor Conceptual GuiManager)".
`dependencies` were updated to reflect the broad impact of this architectural refactoring.
`current_functionality_summary` was enhanced to categorize the numerous responsibilities of the original `g_gui`.
`qt6_migration_steps` and the `boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt` were significantly expanded to:
  - Explicitly name and define the roles of new, focused service classes (e.g., `BrushStateService`, `EditorStateService`, `ClientDataService`, `WindowManagerService`, `ClipboardManager`, `ApplicationSettingsService`).
  - Detail how these services will be owned by `MainWindow` and provided to other application components (like `EditorController`, `MapViewWidget`, palettes, toolbars) via dependency injection.
  - Emphasize the replacement of global `g_gui` calls with interactions with these injected services.
  - Stress the use of signals and slots for communication between these decoupled components.
`definition_of_done` was updated to clearly state the goal: elimination of global UI management in favor of dependency-injected services.
The conceptual nature of the "GuiManager" from UI-03 being refactored *before* full implementation into this service-based architecture was clarified.
