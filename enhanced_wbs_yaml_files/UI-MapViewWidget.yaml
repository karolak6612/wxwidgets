      Declares `MapCanvas` (derived from `wxGLCanvas`), the core map rendering area.
      Manages mouse/keyboard event handling for map navigation (pan, zoom, floor changes),
      drawing operations (delegating to brushes), and selection.
      Interfaces with `MapDrawer` for rendering and `Editor` for game logic.
      Includes logic for scrollbars, focus handling, and context menus.

    description: |
      Implements `MapCanvas`. Contains detailed event handlers for mouse clicks, motion,
      wheel, key presses. Translates screen coordinates to map coordinates.
      Initiates drawing actions, selection changes, and context menu displays.
      Manages visual feedback for dragging, selection rectangles, paste previews.
dependencies:
  - RENDER-01           # The core OpenGL rendering canvas/logic this widget will host/use
  - UI-01               # MainWindow (as potential parent or for context)
  - LOGIC-01            # EditorController (to send user actions like brush strokes, selections)
  - REFACTOR-01         # For services like BrushStateService, EditorStateService to get current tool/mode
  - CORE-06             # AppSettings (for view preferences like scroll speed, zoom levels)
  - LOGIC-01
current_functionality_summary: |
  The `MapCanvas` in wxWidgets is a `wxGLCanvas` that not only renders the map
  (via `MapDrawer`) but also handles all mouse and keyboard input for interacting
  with the map: panning, zooming, changing floors, initiating brush strokes,
  making selections, and showing context menus.
qt6_migration_steps: |
  1. Create `MapViewWidget.h/.cpp` inheriting `QWidget` (or a more specialized Qt base if appropriate, like directly from the class created in `RENDER-01` if that's a QWidget).
  2. This widget will either directly be the `QOpenGLWidget` from `RENDER-01` or will contain an instance of it.
  3. Implement mouse event handlers: `mousePressEvent`, `mouseMoveEvent`, `mouseReleaseEvent`, `wheelEvent`.
     - Translate screen coordinates to map coordinates (respecting zoom, scroll, current floor).
     - Based on current editor mode/tool (from `EditorStateService`) and mouse buttons/modifiers:
       - Initiate panning (middle mouse drag, or space+drag).
       - Initiate zoom (wheel, or specific key+drag).
       - Initiate drawing actions (left click/drag with a brush tool) by calling `EditorController::applyBrushStroke()`.
       - Initiate selection actions (Shift+drag for bounding box, click for single select) by calling `EditorController`.
       - Initiate drag-and-drop of selection.
  4. Implement keyboard event handlers: `keyPressEvent`, `keyReleaseEvent`.
     - Handle floor changes (e.g., PageUp/PageDown).
     - Handle shortcuts for tools, zoom, navigation if not handled globally by `MainWindow`.
  5. Implement context menu: `contextMenuEvent`.
     - Build `QMenu` with relevant actions (Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Properties for selected item/tile) based on context.
     - Connect actions to `EditorController` or other relevant handlers.
  6. Manage scrollbars (if map is larger than view and not using purely drag-to-pan). `QScrollArea` could be a container, or custom scrollbar logic interacting with the viewport's center position.
  7. Display visual feedback:
     - Current brush cursor preview (delegated to `RENDER-01`'s drawing logic but triggered by mouse moves).
     - Selection marquee/rectangle.
     - Paste preview.
  8. Interact with `EditorStateService` to get current floor, mode, etc., and with `BrushStateService` for current brush info.
definition_of_done: |
  - A `MapViewWidget` Qt class is implemented.
  - It successfully hosts and displays the map rendered by the component from `RENDER-01`.
  - Mouse interactions (click, drag, wheel) on the widget correctly trigger:
    - Panning of the map view.
    - Zooming of the map view.
    - Drawing actions (using the active brush from `BrushStateService`) via `EditorController`.
    - Selection actions (e.g., bounding box) via `EditorController`.
  - Keyboard interactions correctly trigger floor changes and other relevant navigation/actions.
  - A context menu appears on right-click with appropriate actions (e.g., Copy, Paste, Properties).
  - Visual feedback for current brush, selection marquee, and paste previews is displayed correctly.
  - Scrollbars are functional if implemented.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: |
  Implement the `MapViewWidget.h` and `MapViewWidget.cpp` Qt classes. This widget is the primary user interface for interacting with the map. It will host the OpenGL rendering canvas from `RENDER-01` (or be that canvas itself if `RENDER-01` produces a QOpenGLWidget subclass) and handle all user input.

  **MapViewWidget.h:**
  ```cpp
  #include <QWidget> // Or your RENDER-01 QOpenGLWidget base class
  // Forward declarations
  class EditorController;
  class EditorStateService;
  class BrushStateService;
  class AppSettings;
  class QMenu;
  // If RENDER-01 is a separate canvas class:
  // class MapOpenGLCanvas; // from RENDER-01

  class MapViewWidget : public QWidget { // Or public MapOpenGLCanvas from RENDER-01
      Q_OBJECT
  public:
      MapViewWidget(EditorController* editorController, EditorStateService* editorState, BrushStateService* brushState, AppSettings* settings, QWidget* parent = nullptr);
      // Methods to set current map, floor, zoom, etc., if not handled by services
      // void setMap(mapcore::Map* map); // Likely handled by EditorController/Session

  protected:
      void mousePressEvent(QMouseEvent* event) override;
      void mouseMoveEvent(QMouseEvent* event) override;
      void mouseReleaseEvent(QMouseEvent* event) override;
      void wheelEvent(QWheelEvent* event) override;
      void keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent* event) override;
      void contextMenuEvent(QContextMenuEvent* event) override;
      // If this IS the QOpenGLWidget from RENDER-01, it will have initializeGL, resizeGL, paintGL.
      // If it CONTAINS the RENDER-01 widget, it will just manage it.

  private:
      EditorController* m_editorController;
      EditorStateService* m_editorStateService;
      BrushStateService* m_brushStateService;
      AppSettings* m_appSettings;
      // MapOpenGLCanvas* m_glCanvas; // If RENDER-01 is a separate contained widget

      // State for dragging, selecting, panning
      bool m_isPanning = false;
      bool m_isSelecting = false;
      bool m_isDrawing = false;
      QPoint m_lastMousePos;
      mapcore::Position m_selectionStartMapPos;

      QMenu* m_contextMenu;
      void createContextMenu();
      mapcore::Position screenToMapCoords(const QPoint& screenPos); // Essential helper
  };
  ```

  **MapViewWidget.cpp:**
  - Constructor: Store service pointers. `createContextMenu()`. Enable mouse tracking.
  - `mousePressEvent`: Based on `m_editorStateService->getCurrentMode()`, `event->button()`, `event->modifiers()`:
    - Start panning (e.g., middle button or space+left). Store `m_lastMousePos`.
    - Start drawing: `m_isDrawing = true; m_editorController->startBrushStroke(); ... m_editorController->applyBrushStrokeAt(mapPos, ...);`.
    - Start selection: `m_isSelecting = true; m_selectionStartMapPos = mapPos;`.
  - `mouseMoveEvent`:
    - If panning: Calculate delta from `m_lastMousePos`, tell `RENDER-01` component to scroll. Update `m_lastMousePos`.
    - If drawing: `m_editorController->applyBrushStrokeAt(mapPos, ...);`.
    - If selecting: Update selection marquee display.
    - Update status bar with current map coordinates.
    - Trigger repaint of brush cursor preview.
  - `mouseReleaseEvent`:
    - If drawing: `m_editorController->finishBrushStroke(); m_isDrawing = false;`.
    - If selecting: `m_editorController->finalizeBoundingBoxSelection(m_selectionStartMapPos, currentMapPos); m_isSelecting = false;`.
    - If panning: `m_isPanning = false;`.
  - `wheelEvent`: Adjust zoom via `EditorController` or directly tell `RENDER-01` component, then `update()`.
  - `keyPressEvent`: Handle floor changes (PageUp/Down -> `m_editorStateService->changeFloor(delta)`), tool shortcuts.
  - `contextMenuEvent`: `m_contextMenu->popup(event->globalPos());`. Update enabled state of actions in `m_contextMenu` based on selection/context.
  - `createContextMenu()`: Create `QAction`s for "Cut", "Copy", "Paste", "Delete", "Tile Properties...", "Item Properties...". Connect to `EditorController` slots.
  - `screenToMapCoords()`: Implement robust conversion.
