boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Integrate CPack into the CMake project. Write a `CPackConfig.cmake` file. Define components for the application executable and the `data/` directory. Configure generators for `WIX` (Windows), `DragNDrop` (macOS), and `DEB` (Linux). Set `CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON` using the application icon.
