===================
Status: PARTIAL
Date: 2024-03-15
Session: 1
Fixes applied: 3 (Q_SLOTS, Q_SIGNALS in .h, Q_EMIT in .cpp for AdvancedSearchWidget; also fixed Q_SLOTS/Q_SIGNALS in BrushFilterManager.h)
Notes:
Corrected Qt meta-object keywords (slots, signals, emit) to their Q_ prefixed versions due to QT_NO_KEYWORDS.
- AdvancedSearchWidget.h: Changed `public slots:` to `public Q_SLOTS:` and `signals:` to `Q_SIGNALS:`.
- AdvancedSearchWidget.cpp: Changed `emit` to `Q_EMIT`.
- BrushFilterManager.h (included by AdvancedSearchWidget.cpp): Changed `public slots:` to `public Q_SLOTS:` and `signals:` to `Q_SIGNALS:`.

These changes are expected to resolve many errors. However, errors like "'RME::RME::RME::RME::RME::QWidget': base class undefined" and repeated undeclared identifiers for class members suggest there might be deeper parsing issues. If these persist, further investigation will be needed. The current fixes address the most obvious problems based on `AGENTS.md` and previous findings.
Remaining: Many errors, potentially cascading. The core issue might be the parser's confusion about QWidget/QString namespaces.
