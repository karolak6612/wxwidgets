===================
Status: COMPLETED
Date: 2024-03-15
Session: 1
Fixes applied: 1 (logical fix: added includes)
Notes:
Added missing includes to `Project_QT/src/core/io/BinaryNode.h`:
- `#include <QString>`
- `#include <QByteArray>`
- `#include <QtGlobal>` (for `qsizetype`)

These additions are expected to resolve all reported errors in both `BinaryNode.h` and `BinaryNode.cpp`. The errors included unrecognized types (QString, QByteArray, qsizetype), which led to cascading syntax errors, incorrect member initialization errors, issues with function signatures, and undeclared identifiers for members whose types were not recognized.
