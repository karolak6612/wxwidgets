    description: Defines 'HouseBrush' (inherits 'Brush') for assigning tiles to a house. Stores 'House* draw_house'.
  - file_path: wxwidgets/house_brush.cpp
    description: Implements 'HouseBrush'. 'draw' assigns current 'draw_house' to tile, sets PZ flag, optionally removes movables or auto-assigns door IDs. 'undraw' clears house ID, PZ, and door IDs.

current_functionality_summary: |
  The 'HouseBrush' assigns a selected house ID to map tiles. It also sets the PZ flag and can optionally remove movable items or auto-assign door IDs to doors on the tile, based on application settings.
qt6_migration_steps: |
  1. Define `mapcore::HouseBrush` class inheriting from `mapcore::Brush`.
  2. Store `mapcore::House* currentDesignatedHouse` (set via palette).
  3. Implement `apply()`:
     - Get target `Tile`.
     - If erasing: Clear tile's house ID, PZ flag. If `AUTO_ASSIGN_DOORID` is on, clear door IDs on tile. Remove tile from `currentDesignatedHouse`'s tile list.
     - If drawing: Set tile's house ID to `currentDesignatedHouse->getID()`. Set PZ flag. If `HOUSE_BRUSH_REMOVE_ITEMS` setting is on, remove movable items. If `AUTO_ASSIGN_DOORID` is on, assign an empty door ID from `currentDesignatedHouse`. Add tile to `currentDesignatedHouse`'s tile list.
     - Record changes for undo.
definition_of_done: |
  - `mapcore::HouseBrush` is implemented.
  - Assigns/unassigns house IDs and PZ flags correctly.
  - Optional item removal and door ID assignment based on settings are functional.
  - Operations are undoable.
  - Unit tests for house assignment, PZ flags, and optional behaviors pass.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: |
  Port `HouseBrush` from `wxwidgets/house_brush.cpp/h` to `mapcore::HouseBrush`.
  1. Header: `mapcore::HouseBrush : public mapcore::Brush`. Store `mapcore::House* m_currentHouse;`. Method `void setCurrentHouse(mapcore::House* house);`.
  2. Source: Implement `apply()`.
     - Drawing: `tile->setHouseId(m_currentHouse->getId()); tile->setFlag(TileState::PZ, true);` Add tile to `m_currentHouse->tiles()`. Handle `AppSettings` for removing items and assigning door IDs (e.g., `m_currentHouse->assignEmptyDoorId(tile)`).
     - Erasing: `tile->setHouseId(0); tile->setFlag(TileState::PZ, false);` Remove tile from old house's list. Handle door IDs.
     - All changes via `EditorControllerInterface`.
