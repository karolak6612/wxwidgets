 Based on my analysis of the code, here's a plan to check which parts of the  
 UI implementation are done and which need to be finished:

  1 ✅ ResourcePathManager has been created and implemented                   
  2 ✅ MainWindow is using ResourcePathManager to load menubar.xml            
  3 ✅ BrushMaterialEditorDialog is using ResourcePathManager for XML files   
  4 ✅ resources.qrc has been updated with all required resources
