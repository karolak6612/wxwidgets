title: Port Brush & Materials System
input_files:
- brush.h/cpp (and all *_brush.*)
- materials.h/cpp
- tileset.h/cpp
dependencies:
- CORE-02
definition_of_done: The Brush and Material/Tileset systems are ported to `mapcore`. All brush types are functional but without UI counterparts. XML loading logic is ported to use `QXmlStreamReader`.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Port all brush classes and the `Materials`/`Tileset` system to `mapcore`. Replace `pugixml` parsing logic with `QXmlStreamReader`. Brushes should operate on the `CORE-01` data models.
