===================
Status: COMPLETED
Date: 2024-03-15
Session: 1
Fixes applied: 3 (logical fix types)
Notes:
1. In `BrushManagerService.h`:
   - Changed `signals:` to `Q_SIGNALS:` for `QT_NO_KEYWORDS` compliance.
2. In `BrushManagerService.cpp`:
   - Added `#include <memory>` for `std::unique_ptr` and `std::make_unique`.
   - Changed all instances of `emit` to `Q_EMIT`.

These changes are expected to resolve all reported errors in `BrushManagerService.json`. Cascading errors related to unrecognized class structure, members, std library functions (make_unique, move), and types (BrushSettings, BrushShape) should be fixed now that the header is syntactically correct and necessary includes are present.
