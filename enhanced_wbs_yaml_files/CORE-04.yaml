current_functionality_summary: |-
  The specified files define the map editing brushes and the material/tileset system.
  - `brush.h/cpp` & `*_brush.h/cpp` files: Define a hierarchy of brush classes (Base `Brush`, `TerrainBrush`, `GroundBrush`, `WallBrush`, `DoodadBrush`, etc.) responsible for the logic of placing/modifying map elements. `Brushes` (`g_brushes`) is a global manager for these.
  - `materials.h/cpp`: Defines `Materials` (`g_materials`), which loads `materials.xml` (which would have been parsed by pugixml). This XML defines brush properties, items used by brushes, border rules (`AutoBorder`), and organizes them into tilesets. It also handles material extensions.
  - `tileset.h/cpp`: Defines `Tileset` and `TilesetCategory` for organizing brushes, primarily for the UI palette.
  These systems depend on `CORE-01` data models and `CORE-02` asset definitions.
  Note: The `materials.xml` file was not directly accessible for analysis during task generation; understanding of its expected structure is inferred from the C++ parsing code (`Materials::loadMaterials`, `Brushes::unserializeBrush`, etc.) and `prompt.md`.
qt6_migration_steps: |-
  1. Port all brush classes (`Brush` hierarchy, `Brushes` manager, `AutoBorder`), `Materials` manager, `Tileset`, and `TilesetCategory` classes to the `mapcore` library. Ensure these are structured as individual `.h/.cpp` files within `mapcore`.
  2. In `Materials::loadMaterials` and related XML parsing methods (e.g., `Brushes::unserializeBrush`, `AutoBorder::load`), replace all `pugixml` usage with `QXmlStreamReader`. The Coder AI will need to infer the XML structure from the existing C++ parsing logic or define a new one if the original `materials.xml` is unavailable.
  3. Remove all wxWidgets dependencies:
     - Convert `wxString` to `std::string`.
     - Convert `wxArrayString` to `std::vector<std::string>`.
     - Convert `wxFileName` to `std::filesystem::path` or `QFileInfo`.
     - Remove wx-specific logging or utilities.
  4. Ensure brush implementations correctly interact with the data models from `CORE-01` (e.g., `Tile`, `Item`) and use asset definitions (e.g., `g_items`, `g_creatures`) now managed within `mapcore` (as per `CORE-02`).
  5. Manage `g_brushes` and `g_materials` as singletons or context-owned instances within `mapcore`.
  6. The `Tileset` and `TilesetCategory` data structures should be ported. Their primary role is data provision for the UI; remove any direct UI rendering or interaction logic if present.
  7. Update path handling in `Materials::loadExtensions` to use `std::filesystem::path` or `QDir`/`QFileInfo` for directory iteration and loading extension XMLs.
  8. Verify that `mapcore` compiles cleanly with the ported brush and materials system, ensuring no wxWidgets or pugixml dependencies remain.
definition_of_done: |-
  The brush system and materials/tileset definitions are successfully ported to and functional within the `mapcore` library.
  Key requirements:
  - All brush classes (`Brush` hierarchy, `Brushes` manager, `AutoBorder`) and the `Materials`/`Tileset` system are part of `mapcore`, with each class in its own modular files.
  - XML parsing for `materials.xml` and extensions is done using Qt XML (`QXmlStreamReader`), completely replacing pugixml. The structure of `materials.xml` will be based on the existing parsing logic in C++.
  - All wxWidgets dependencies are removed from these classes.
  - Brushes correctly operate on the `CORE-01` data models and use assets from `CORE-02`.
  - The `mapcore` library, including these systems, compiles cleanly.
  - The brush and tileset data structures are populated correctly after parsing `materials.xml` (and extensions).
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: |-
  Your task is to port the brush system (all classes derived from `Brush`, the `Brushes` manager, `AutoBorder`) and the materials system (`Materials`, `Tileset`, `TilesetCategory`) to the `mapcore` static library. This depends on `CORE-01` and `CORE-02`.
  1. Relocate all relevant classes to `mapcore`, maintaining them as separate `.h/.cpp` files within the library's source structure.
  2. Replace all `pugixml` usage with `QXmlStreamReader` for parsing `materials.xml` and any material extension XML files (e.g., in `Materials::loadMaterials`, `Brushes::unserializeBrush`, `AutoBorder::load`, and individual brush `load` methods). Infer the XML structure from the existing C++ parsing code as the original `materials.xml` might not be directly available.
  3. Remove all wxWidgets dependencies (e.g., `wxString` to `std::string`, `wxArrayString` to `std::vector<std::string>`, `wxFileName` to `std::filesystem::path` or `QFileInfo`).
  4. Ensure that the brush logic correctly interacts with the data models from `CORE-01` and asset definitions from `CORE-02` (now part of `mapcore`).
  5. `Tileset` and `TilesetCategory` should be ported as data structures. Remove any direct UI code from them.
  6. The global instances `g_brushes` and `g_materials` should be managed within `mapcore`.
  7. Confirm `mapcore` compiles cleanly and the materials system can successfully load its configuration from `materials.xml` (or its C++-inferred structure).
