  All remaining utility dialogs (`Add Item`, `Add Tileset`, `Ground Validation`) are re-implemented as `QDialog` subclasses. Their functionality is ported to interact with the new `mapcore` data models and `ActionQueue`.

  For each dialog in the input files, create a new `QDialog` subclass. Replicate the UI and logic. Connect the "OK" or "Apply" button's `clicked()` signal to a slot that creates and pushes an `Action` to the `ActionQueue` to perform the modification.
