    description: Defines 'WallBrush' and 'WallDecorationBrush' (inheriting 'TerrainBrush'). 'WallBrush' includes structures for 'WallType' and 'DoorType'.
  - file_path: wxwidgets/wall_brush.cpp
    description: Implements 'WallBrush'. Handles loading definitions from XML, randomizing variations. 'doWalls' calculates and applies correct wall segment (vertical, horizontal, corners, poles, T-junctions, etc.) based on adjacent walls.

current_functionality_summary: |
  The 'WallBrush' draws various wall types, automatically selecting segments (vertical, horizontal, corners, poles, T-junctions, diagonals, intersections) and handling associated door/window items. Logic includes randomizing variations and connecting to adjacent walls.
qt6_migration_steps: |
  1. Define `mapcore::WallBrush` class inheriting from `mapcore::Brush` (or `TerrainBrush`).
  2. Store current wall brush definition (item IDs for alignments, door/window types) loaded from `MaterialManager`.
  3. Implement `apply()`:
     - If erasing: Remove wall item. Trigger updates for neighbors.
     - If drawing: Implement 'doWalls' logic: Analyze neighbors to select correct wall segment/door/window item ID. Place item.
     - Record changes for undo.
definition_of_done: |
  - `mapcore::WallBrush` is implemented.
  - Wall brush definitions are loaded and used.
  - Auto-connection logic correctly places wall segments, doors, and windows.
  - Operations are undoable.
  - Unit tests for wall placement and auto-connection pass.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: |
  Port `WallBrush` from `wxwidgets/wall_brush.cpp/h` to `mapcore::WallBrush`.
  1. Header: `mapcore::WallBrush : public mapcore::Brush` (or `TerrainBrush`). Store current wall definition (from `MaterialManager`).
  2. Source: Implement `apply()`. This is very complex. The 'doWalls' logic needs to check 8 surrounding tiles to determine the correct wall piece (straight, corner, T-junction, cross, end-piece, etc.) and orientation. Handle door/window placement within walls. All changes via `EditorControllerInterface`.
