===================
Status: COMPLETED
Date: 2024-03-15
Session: 1
Fixes applied: 3 (logical fix types)
Notes:
1. In `BrushIconWidget.h`:
   - Changed `signals:` to `Q_SIGNALS:`.
   - Reordered member variable declarations (`m_brush`, `m_selected`, `m_iconSize`, `m_showLabel`) to appear before their use in inline getter methods.
2. In `BrushIconWidget.cpp`:
   - Changed `emit` to `Q_EMIT`.

These changes are expected to resolve all reported errors in `BrushIconWidget.json`, including cascading errors related to unrecognized class structure, members, and Qt types like QPainter.
