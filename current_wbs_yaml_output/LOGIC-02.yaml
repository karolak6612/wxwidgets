title: Implement Bounding-Box Selection
input_files:
- selection.h/cpp
- map_display.cpp
dependencies:
- UI-EVENT-01
- CORE-05
definition_of_done: In `SELECTION_MODE`, dragging the mouse on the `MapView` creates a visual bounding box. Releasing the mouse populates the `Selection` object with all `Tile`s and/or `Item`s within that box. This operation is undoable.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: In `MapView`'s mouse event handlers, detect a drag operation in `SELECTION_MODE`. In `paintGL`, draw a 2D rectangle from the drag-start point to the current cursor position. On `mouseReleaseEvent`, calculate the map area covered by the rectangle and populate the `Selection` object from `CORE-05` via an `Action`.
