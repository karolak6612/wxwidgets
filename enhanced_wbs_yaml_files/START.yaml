current_functionality_summary: |
  This YAML file represents the conceptual start of the Work Breakdown Structure
  for the RME-Qt migration project. It can serve as a root node in a project
  management view or as a placeholder for listing all major top-level tasks or phases.
  It does not correspond to a specific piece of code to be ported but rather to the
  overall project definition itself.
qt6_migration_steps: |
  1. Define all major task categories (BUILD, CORE, DATA (now part of CORE), DOCS, FINAL, LOGIC, NET, REFACTOR, RENDER, TEST, UI).
  2. List all top-level WBS items (YAML files) under their respective categories.
  3. (Optional) Define project phases if applicable (e.g., Phase 1: Core Porting, Phase 2: UI Implementation, Phase 3: Testing & Finalization).
  4. This file can be used by project management tools or scripts to get an overview of all defined tasks.
definition_of_done: |
  - `START.yaml` is created.
  - It provides a high-level overview or entry point for understanding the project's WBS structure.
  - (Optional) It lists major task categories or phases and references key top-level tasks.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: |
  Create the `START.yaml` file.
  Its purpose is to be the root or entry point for the WBS.
  - Set `id: START`
  - Set `section: Project Management`
  - Set `title: Project Start and Overall WBS Definition`
  - Dependencies can include the very first task, e.g., `BUILD-00`.
  - The description fields should explain its role as a meta-task for project organization.
