  <current_functionality_summary>This XML file represents the conceptual start of the Work Breakdown Structure
for the RME-Qt migration project. It can serve as a root node in a project
management view or as a placeholder for listing all major top-level tasks or phases.
It does not correspond to a specific piece of code to be ported but rather to the
overall project definition itself.
</current_functionality_summary>
  <qt6_migration_steps>1. Define all major task categories (BUILD, CORE, DATA (now part of CORE), DOCS, FINAL, LOGIC, NET, REFACTOR, RENDER, TEST, UI).
2. List all top-level WBS items (XML files) under their respective categories.
3. (Optional) Define project phases if applicable (e.g., Phase 1: Core Porting, Phase 2: UI Implementation, Phase 3: Testing &amp; Finalization).
4. This file can be used by project management tools or scripts to get an overview of all defined tasks.
</qt6_migration_steps>
  <definition_of_done>- `START.XML` is created.
- It provides a high-level overview or entry point for understanding the project's WBS structure.
- (Optional) It lists major task categories or phases and references key top-level tasks.
</definition_of_done>
  <boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt>Create the `START.XML` file.
Its purpose is to be the root or entry point for the WBS.
- Set `id: START`
- Set `section: Project Management`
- Set `title: Project Start and Overall WBS Definition`
- Dependencies can include the very first task, e.g., `BUILD-00`.
- The description fields should explain its role as a meta-task for project organization.
