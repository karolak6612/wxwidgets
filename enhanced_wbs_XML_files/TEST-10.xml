  <current_functionality_summary>This WBS item outlines the crucial process of testing the Qt6 Remere's Map Editor application for UI and functional consistency across its primary target operating systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux. It involves a combination of systematic manual exploratory testing, guided by a comprehensive checklist, and the execution of the automated UI test suite developed in 'TEST-09'. The main objective is to identify and document any platform-specific bugs, visual glitches, layout problems, or behavioral inconsistencies to ensure a high-quality user experience on all supported platforms.

    <element>High (15-25 QA/developer days). Setting up multiple test environments, meticulously executing a broad checklist manually on each, running automated suites, and then thoroughly documenting/reporting all findings is a significant time investment.

  <boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt>*This WBS item, 'TEST-10', describes a **testing and reporting process** to be executed primarily by QA engineers or developers. The AI's role is to understand this process and the expected inputs/outputs, particularly the structure of the test report and the types of issues to look for. It does not involve direct code generation for the application itself, but might involve scripting for test automation if that were part of the test execution.*

**Objective:**
To: systematically test the Qt6 Remere's Map Editor across Windows, macOS, and Linux to identify and document platform-specific UI/UX bugs, inconsistencies, and visual glitches.

**Inputs for Tester/QA:**
- A stable, feature-rich build of the RME-Qt application (ideally a release candidate or post 'FINAL-05').
- Access to testing environments for Windows, macOS, and specified Linux distributions/desktop environments.
- The automated UI test suite developed in 'TEST-09'.
- A pre-defined UI testing checklist (or the task to develop one as the first step).

**Procedure for Tester/QA:**

1.  **Develop/Finalize UI Testing Checklist:** If not already existing, create a detailed checklist covering:
    *   Installation and launch.
    *   Main window layout (menus, toolbars, dock widgets, status bar) on different screen resolutions and High DPI settings.
    *   All major dialogs (File New/Open/Save, Preferences, Map Properties, Item Properties, Town Editor, House Editor, etc.): layout, control functionality, native feel.
    *   Palette interaction: selecting brushes, items, creatures; UI feedback.
    *   Map canvas interaction: basic drawing, selection, panning, zooming, floor changes â€“ visual feedback and basic functional correctness (detailed rendering logic is 'TEST-07').
    *   Font rendering across all UI elements.
    *   Keyboard navigation and shortcuts (including platform-specific equivalents like Cmd vs Ctrl).
    *   Drag and drop (e.g., for dock widgets).
    *   Window management (minimize, maximize, resize, fullscreen).
    *   Overall application responsiveness (qualitative assessment).

2.  **Execute Manual Tests on Each Platform:**
    *   For Windows, macOS, and each targeted Linux environment:
        - Install the application.
        - Systematically go through the UI testing checklist, noting any deviations, visual bugs, or unexpected behavior.
        - Pay special attention to High DPI scaling, font rendering, and native widget integration (e.g., file dialogs, menu bars on macOS).

3.  **Execute Automated UI Tests (from 'TEST-09') on Each Platform:**
    *   Run the full suite of automated UI tests.
    *   Record all failures and investigate if they are platform-specific or general bugs.

4.  **Document Findings:**
    *   For each issue found:
        - Provide a clear title and detailed steps to reproduce.
        - Specify the platform(s) affected (OS version, desktop environment, display settings if relevant).
        - Include screenshots and/or short videos.
        - Assess severity (e.g., critical, major, minor, cosmetic) and impact.
        - Note if the issue is a regression from a previous version or a new problem.
    *   File these issues in the project's designated bug tracking system.

5.  **Compile Cross-Platform Test Report:**
    *   **Introduction:** Purpose of the testing, scope, application version tested.
    *   **Test Environments:** Detailed list of OS versions, hardware configurations (if relevant), Qt version used for build.
    *   **Manual Test Execution Summary:** Overview of checklist completion for each platform.
    *   **Automated Test Execution Summary:** Pass/fail rates for the UI test suite on each platform.
    *   **Key Findings &amp; Issues:**
        - A section for each platform, detailing significant bugs and inconsistencies discovered.
        - A consolidated list of high-priority cross-platform issues or patterns observed.
    *   **High DPI and Scaling Report:** Specific feedback on UI scalability and clarity on high-resolution displays.
    *   **Accessibility Notes (Optional):** Basic observations on keyboard navigation, focus handling, etc.
    *   **Conclusion and Recommendations:** Overall assessment of cross-platform compatibility. Recommendations for addressing common issues or areas needing developer attention.

The primary output of this task is the **Cross-Platform Test Report** and the filed **bug reports**.
