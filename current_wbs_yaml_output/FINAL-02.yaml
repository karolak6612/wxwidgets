title: Create Final CMake Build System
input_files:
- (all files)
dependencies: ALL
definition_of_done: A root `CMakeLists.txt` is created that correctly builds the `mapcore` static library and the final `RME-Qt` executable. It must locate and link all dependencies (Qt6, OpenGL).
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Write a top-level `CMakeLists.txt`. Add `mapcore` as a subdirectory library. Create an executable target for the main application and link it against `Qt6::Widgets`, `Qt6::OpenGL`, and `mapcore`.
