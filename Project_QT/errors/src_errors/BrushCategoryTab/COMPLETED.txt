===================
Status: COMPLETED
Date: 2024-03-15
Session: 1
Fixes applied: 2 (logical fix types)
Notes:
1. Corrected Qt meta-object keywords in `Project_QT/src/ui/palettes/BrushCategoryTab.h`:
   - Changed `public slots:` to `public Q_SLOTS:`.
   - Changed `signals:` to `Q_SIGNALS:`.
   This is required due to `QT_NO_KEYWORDS` being defined.
2. Reordered member variable declarations (`m_category`, `m_viewMode`, `m_searchFilter`) in `BrushCategoryTab.h` to appear before their use in inline getter methods. This resolved 'undeclared identifier' errors for these members.
All errors in `BrushCategoryTab.json` are expected to be resolved.
