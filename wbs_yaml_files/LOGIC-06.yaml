  When the house or exit brush is active, clicks on the `MapView` correctly assign house tiles or move the house exit. This creates an undoable `Action`. The same applies to placing waypoints.

  In `MapView::mousePressEvent`, when the active brush is `HouseBrush`, `HouseExitBrush`, or `WaypointBrush`, invoke a controller method to apply the change. The controller must create the appropriate `Change` and wrap it in an `Action`.
