definition_of_done: Cut, Copy, Paste, and selection drag-and-move operations are fully functional. These actions must be correctly integrated with the `CopyBuffer` and the `ActionQueue` to support undo/redo. Paste must enter a visual "pasting" mode.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Implement slots in `MainWindow` for `cut`, `copy`, and `paste` actions. Connect them to the respective `QAction`s. Port the logic from `CopyBuffer` and the `moveSelection` function in `editor.cpp`. For pasting, the `MapView` must enter a state to show a ghost of the paste buffer under the cursor.
