title: Port Borderize & Randomize Tools
input_files:
- editor.cpp (borderize*
- randomize*)
- borderize_window.h/cpp
dependencies:
- LOGIC-02
definition_of_done: Menu actions for "Borderize" and "Randomize" (on both selection and full map) are functional. The `BorderizeWindow` is recreated as a `QDialog` and successfully orchestrates the operation in chunks.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Create a `BorderizeDialog` class inheriting from `QDialog`, replicating the UI of `BorderizeWindow` with Qt widgets. Connect the `Map > Borderize` `QAction` to a slot that shows this dialog. Implement the tile iteration and brush application logic from `editor.cpp`.
