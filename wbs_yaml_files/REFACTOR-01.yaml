  The `GuiManager` singleton from `UI-03` is eliminated. Its responsibilities (e.g., managing the active brush) are moved into smaller, focused classes. A dependency injection or modern service locator pattern is used in `MainWindow` to provide these services to widgets that need them.

  Refactor the `GuiManager` singleton. Move brush management logic to a `BrushManager` class. Move UI state logic to a `ViewStateManager` class. `MainWindow` will instantiate these managers and provide pointers or references to child widgets through their constructors, removing the need for a global accessor.
