definition_of_done: All brush drawing modes (drag-and-draw, square/circle shape) are functional in the `MapView`. Special brushes (wall, table, carpet, door, etc.) apply their automatic bordering and connection logic correctly when used.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Port the logic from `MapCanvas::OnMouseActionClick` and `MapCanvas::OnMouseActionRelease`. In the `MapView`'s mouse event handlers, check the `GuiManager` for the active brush and its settings (size, shape) and create a `PositionVector` of tiles to be affected, then pass this to the controller to execute a drawing `Action`.
