      Defines the interfaces for the action and history (undo/redo) system. Key classes declared:
      - `Change`: Encapsulates an atomic change to the map state (e.g., a modified tile, moved house exit, moved waypoint). It stores the type of change and a pointer to data representing the *previous* state of the affected object.
      - `DirtyList`: A helper class to track changed map areas (by position/floor using a custom set of `ValueType`) and specific `Change` objects. This is likely used for optimized screen refresh or for network updates in live editing sessions.
      - `Action`: Represents a single undoable/redoable editor operation (e.g., drawing, deleting). It contains a list (`ChangeList`) of `Change` objects that constitute the operation. Key methods are `commit()` (to apply changes to the map) and `undo()` (to revert them). It's identified by an `ActionIdentifier` enum.
      - `BatchAction`: Groups multiple `Action` instances. Actions of the same type occurring in rapid succession (within a stacking delay) can be merged into a single `BatchAction`. It manages committing, undoing, and redoing its contained actions.
      - `ActionQueue`: Manages a deque (`ActionList`) of `BatchAction` objects, providing the main undo/redo stack. It handles stack limits based on memory usage or action count and the merging of consecutive compatible actions.

      Implements the classes declared in `action.h`.
      - `Change`: Constructor initializes the change type and data (e.g., takes a `Tile*` and stores it). The destructor `clear()` is crucial for releasing the memory of the stored state data based on its type (e.g., deleting the `Tile*` or `std::pair` for moves).
      - `Action`: The constructor takes an `Editor&` and an `ActionIdentifier`. The `commit()` method applies the changes to the live map data by swapping the current map state with the state stored in its `Change` objects (effectively making the `Change` object now hold the state that was previously on the map). It interacts with `Editor` and `Map` to update game elements like spawns, houses, and tile selection. The `undo()` method reverses this process.
      - `BatchAction`: Manages an `ActionVector`. Provides methods to add actions, which are then committed. `commit()`, `undo()`, `redo()` methods iterate over the contained actions. `merge()` allows combining subsequent compatible batches.
      - `ActionQueue`: Implements the undo/redo stack logic. `addAction()`/`addBatch()` handle adding new operations, including logic for merging actions based on `stacking_delay` and `GROUP_ACTIONS` setting, and managing undo stack limits (`UNDO_MEM_SIZE`, `UNDO_SIZE` from `Config`). `undo()` and `redo()` manipulate the `current` index within the `actions` deque.

current_functionality_summary: |
  The existing action system in RME is custom-built and manages undo/redo operations.
  - `Change`: Encapsulates the data for a single atomic modification, typically storing a copy of the `Tile` object before changes, or specific data for moves (like old position of a house exit).
  - `Action`: Represents a user-level operation (e.g., drawing a brush stroke, deleting selection). It holds a list of `Change` objects. Key methods are `commit()` to apply the changes to the map and `undo()` to revert them by applying the stored `Change` data back to the map.
  - `BatchAction`: Groups multiple `Action` instances. This is used to combine related actions that occur in quick succession (e.g., multiple small brush strokes) into a single undoable step, based on a stacking delay.
  - `ActionQueue`: Manages a deque of `BatchAction` objects. This forms the undo/redo stack. It has logic to limit the stack size by memory usage or number of actions and handles the merging of new actions into existing batches if they are compatible and occur within the stacking delay.
qt6_migration_steps: |
  1.  **Evaluate Qt's Undo Framework:**
      -   Thoroughly investigate `QUndoStack` and `QUndoCommand` from the Qt framework.
      -   Determine if `QUndoStack` can replace `ActionQueue` and `QUndoCommand` can replace `Action` and `BatchAction`.
      -   Assess how `Change` objects (storing previous state) map to `QUndoCommand`'s way of storing information for undo/redo. `QUndoCommand` typically requires implementing `undo()` and `redo()` methods where the command itself holds the necessary data or logic to revert/reapply.

  2.  **Design Base Command Class (if using `QUndoCommand`):**
      -   Create a base `AppUndoCommand` (derived from `QUndoCommand`).
      -   This base class might handle common functionalities, e.g., storing pointers to the map or other core services.
      -   It will require reimplementing `undo()` and `redo()` virtual functions.

  3.  **Port `Change` Logic:**
      -   The concept of `Change` (storing old tile data, etc.) needs to be integrated into each concrete `QUndoCommand` or custom `Action` class.
      -   Instead of `Change` objects holding raw `Tile*` that are swapped, the `QUndoCommand` itself will likely need to store the *delta* or enough information to reconstruct the previous state or re-apply the new state. For example, a `DrawTileCommand` might store the `Position` and a copy of the `Tile` *before* the draw, and another copy of the `Tile` *after* the draw. `undo()` would restore the "before" tile, `redo()` would restore the "after" tile.

  4.  **Implement Concrete Commands/Actions:**
      -   For each existing `ActionIdentifier` (e.g., `ACTION_DRAW`, `ACTION_DELETE_TILES`), create a corresponding concrete command class (e.g., `DrawCommand`, `DeleteTilesCommand`) derived from `AppUndoCommand` or a custom `Action` base.
      -   Each command will take necessary parameters in its constructor (e.g., position, brush info, list of selected tiles).
      -   The `redo()` (or `execute()`) method will perform the action on the map data (ported in `CORE-03`).
      -   The `undo()` method will revert the action.
      -   Memory management for any data stored by the command (e.g., copies of tiles) must be handled within the command class.

  5.  **Implement `ActionQueue` (or use `QUndoStack`):**
      -   If using `QUndoStack`, it will manage the command history.
      -   If a custom `ActionQueue` is ported:
          -   It will store `std::unique_ptr<Action>` (or `std::unique_ptr<AppUndoCommand>`).
          -   Port logic for `undo()`, `redo()`, adding commands (`push`), and clearing the redo stack on new commands.
          -   Implement stack limits (size/memory).
          -   The "batching" or "stacking delay" logic from `BatchAction` needs to be re-evaluated. `QUndoCommand` has `mergeWith()` which can achieve similar results if commands are compatible. A custom solution might involve a timer to merge commands pushed in rapid succession.

  6.  **Integration with Editor/Map:**
      -   Editor operations will now create instances of these new command classes and push them onto the `QUndoStack` (or custom `ActionQueue`).
      -   The `DirtyList` concept for updating UI or network needs to be re-implemented. Commands can emit signals after `redo()`/`undo()`, or the `QUndoStack` itself has signals like `indexChanged`.

  7.  **Unit Testing:**
      -   Create unit tests for `QUndoStack` (or custom `ActionQueue`) behavior: push, undo, redo, stack limits, merging.
      -   Create unit tests for key concrete command classes, verifying their `undo()` and `redo()` logic with mock map data.
definition_of_done: |
  - A robust undo/redo system is implemented, either using Qt's `QUndoStack` and `QUndoCommand` or a custom-ported equivalent of `ActionQueue` and `Action`.
  - The system supports adding commands/actions, performing undo, and performing redo operations.
  - Logic for managing the undo/redo stack, including stack limits (by size or memory) and clearing the redo stack when new commands are pushed, is functional.
  - The concept of `Change` objects (for storing state to enable undo) is correctly implemented within each concrete command/action.
  - Key editor operations (e.g., drawing, deleting, pasting - at least stubs for their actions) are implemented as concrete commands that can be managed by the undo system.
  - The action system correctly interacts with the ported map data structures (`Map`, `Tile`, `Item` from `CORE-01`/`CORE-03`).
  - Memory management for commands and their associated data is handled correctly (e.g., using smart pointers or Qt's ownership model).
  - The "batching" or "stacking delay" feature for merging similar consecutive actions is implemented or a clear decision is made on its replacement/omission.
  - Unit tests verify the functionality of the undo stack (add, undo, redo, limits) and at least one representative concrete command.
  - The ported code compiles successfully within the `mapcore` library.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: |
  You are to port the action and history (undo/redo) system from an old C++ codebase (based on `action.h` and `action.cpp`) to a modern C++/Qt6 environment, preferably using Qt's `QUndoStack` and `QUndoCommand`. This system will be part of a `mapcore` library.

  **1. Base Command (`AppUndoCommand` from `QUndoCommand`):**
     - Create a base class `AppUndoCommand` inheriting `QUndoCommand`.
     - It might hold a pointer to the main `Map` object or an interface to map manipulation services.

  **2. Concrete Commands (e.g., `DrawTileCommand`, `DeleteSelectionCommand`):**
     - For each major editor operation, create a class derived from `AppUndoCommand`.
     - Constructor: Takes parameters needed for the operation (e.g., `Position`, `Brush*`, list of `Tile*`).
     - `redo()` method: Implements the logic to perform the action on the `Map` data. It must store necessary data to enable `undo()`. For example, if changing a tile, it might store a deep copy of the tile *before* modification.
     - `undo()` method: Implements the logic to revert the action, using the data stored during `redo()`. For example, restoring the saved copy of the tile.
     - (Optional) `mergeWith(const QUndoCommand *other)`: Implement if you want to combine consecutive similar commands (e.g., multiple small brush strokes into one undo step).
     - (Optional) `id()`: Can return an ID for command type checking if needed for merging.

  **3. Undo Stack Management:**
     - Use a global or context-owned `QUndoStack` instance.
     - When an editor operation occurs, create an instance of the corresponding concrete command and `push()` it onto the `QUndoStack`.

  **4. `Change` Object Equivalence:**
     - The original system used `Change` objects to store old tile data. In the `QUndoCommand` pattern, this data is typically stored as member variables within the concrete command itself during the `redo()` (or initial execution) phase, so `undo()` can access it. For example, a command modifying a tile might store a `std::unique_ptr<TileData>` representing the tile's state before modification.

  **5. `DirtyList` Equivalence:**
     - After a command's `redo()` or `undo()` is called, the command (or the `QUndoStack` via its signals like `indexChanged()`) should notify the application that the map data has changed so the UI can refresh. This can be done via Qt signals/slots or a callback mechanism. List the affected positions or tiles if possible for optimized updates.

  **General Porting Instructions:**
     - Replace wxWidgets types with Qt/STL equivalents.
     - Use smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `QSharedPointer`) for managing dynamically allocated data within commands if not handled by Qt's ownership.
     - Ensure commands correctly interact with the `Map`, `Tile`, and `Item` classes ported in `CORE-01` and `CORE-03`.
     - Provide header (.h) and source (.cpp) files for the base command (if any) and a few example concrete commands.
     - Write basic Qt Test unit tests for `QUndoStack` usage (push, undo, redo) and for the `undo()`/`redo()` logic of example commands.
