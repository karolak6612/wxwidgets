  A testing framework (e.g., CTest with Google Test) is integrated into the CMake build. Unit tests are written for critical functions in `mapcore`, including `Map` manipulation, `Tile` state changes, and `ItemDatabase` lookups. Code coverage for the core library is reported.

  Integrate the Google Test framework with the CMake project. Write unit tests for the `Map` class in the `mapcore` library. Tests must cover adding/removing tiles, finding tiles by position, and verifying map dimensions. Configure CTest to run these tests.
