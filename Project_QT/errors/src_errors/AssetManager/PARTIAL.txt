===================
Status: PARTIAL
Date: 2024-03-15
Session: 1
Fixes applied: Multiple namespace corrections for AssetManager and related classes.
Notes:
1. Corrected namespaces for ClientVersionManager, MaterialManager, ItemData, CreatureData, SpriteData, ClientProfile in AssetManager.h and AssetManager.cpp.
2. Corrected method signatures in SpriteManager.h (for loadDatSpr) and MaterialManager.h (for loadMaterialsFromDirectory and AssetManager forward declaration) to ensure type consistency with AssetManager.

Many initial errors related to type recognition and namespace mismatches should be resolved.
Remaining issues:
- Discrepancies between `ItemData` struct definition and its usage in `AssetManager`'s `IItemTypeProvider` implementations (missing `description`, `flags`, `hasFlag`).
- Calls to `AssetManager::resolvePath` with incorrect number of arguments.
- Potential other cascading errors.
These will require further investigation after these namespace fixes are processed.
