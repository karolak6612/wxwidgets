    description: Defines 'SpawnBrush' (inherits 'Brush'). Used to designate tiles as spawn points and set their radius.
  - file_path: wxwidgets/spawn_brush.cpp
    description: Implements 'SpawnBrush'. 'draw' creates a 'Spawn' object on the tile with radius from brush size. 'undraw' removes 'Spawn' object.

current_functionality_summary: |
  The 'SpawnBrush' designates a tile as a spawn point and sets its radius, typically taken from global brush size settings. It doesn't handle the list of creatures to spawn; that's often coupled with creature placement or a separate spawn editing UI.
qt6_migration_steps: |
  1. Define `mapcore::SpawnBrush` class inheriting from `mapcore::Brush`.
  2. Implement `apply()`:
     - Get target `Tile`. Get desired radius from `BrushSettings`.
     - If erasing: `tile->clearSpawnData();` (or equivalent method to remove spawn properties).
     - If drawing: `tile->setSpawnData(radius, existingOrEmptyCreatureList, existingOrDefaultSpawnTime);`. The creature list and time might be default or preserved if tile was already a spawn.
     - Record changes for undo.
definition_of_done: |
  - `mapcore::SpawnBrush` is implemented.
  - Applying the brush correctly marks/unmarks tiles as spawn points and sets their radius.
  - Operations are undoable.
  - Unit tests for spawn brush functionality pass.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: |
  Port `SpawnBrush` from `wxwidgets/spawn_brush.cpp/h` to `mapcore::SpawnBrush`.
  1. Header: `mapcore::SpawnBrush : public mapcore::Brush`.
  2. Source: Implement `apply()`. Drawing: `int radius = brushSettings.size; tile->setSpawnData(radius, tile->getCreatureSpawnList(), tile->getSpawnTimeSeconds());` (Preserves existing creature list/time if any, otherwise they'd be default). Erasing: `tile->clearSpawnData();`. All changes via `EditorControllerInterface`.
