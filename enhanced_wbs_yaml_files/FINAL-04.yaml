      The Qt widget responsible for rendering the map. It needs methods to:
      - Adjust zoom level (e.g., `setZoom(double)`, `zoomIn()`, `zoomOut()`).
      - Change current floor being viewed (`setCurrentFloor(int)`).
      - Toggle visibility of various map elements (grid, creatures, spawns, lights, etc.), likely by updating a `MapDrawingOptions` struct which it uses during rendering.
      These methods will be called by slots connected to View menu actions.

      The main application window containing the View and Tools menus, toolbars, and dock widgets for palettes.
      It needs to:
      - Connect View/Tools menu `QAction`s to handler slots.
      - Manage the visibility of toolbars (`QToolBar`) and dock widgets (`QDockWidget` containing palettes) based on View menu actions.
      - Potentially host dialogs launched from the Tools menu (e.g., Map Properties).
  - file_path: "core::AppSettings (from CORE-06)"
    description: |
      The application's settings manager. Many View menu options (e.g., show/hide states for UI elements, default visibility flags for map elements)
      should be persisted as application settings using `AppSettings` so they are remembered across sessions.

    description: |
      The `QAction` objects for various View menu items (Zoom In/Out/Normal, Floor navigation, Show/Hide Grid, Lights, Creatures, Spawns, Toolbars, Palettes)
      and common Tools menu items (e.g., Map Properties, Find Item). Their `triggered()` signals need to be connected to implementing slots.
      Checkable actions should have their state synced with `AppSettings`.
  - file_path: "Palette Widgets (from UI-PALETTES-ALL)"

      The actual QDockWidget instances containing the different palettes (Terrain, Item, Doodad, etc.).
      Their visibility will be toggled by actions in the View > Palettes submenu.
dependencies:
  - FINAL-01  # Core-UI integration, AppContext, MainWindow, MapViewport
  - CORE-06  # AppSettings for persisting view preferences
  - UI-01    # MainWindow structure for managing toolbars/docks
  - UI-02    # View and Tools Menu QAction definitions
  - UI-PALETTES-ALL # For palette QDockWidget instances to show/hide
  - RENDER-01 # For MapViewport's drawing options and zoom/floor capabilities
current_functionality_summary: |
  Following `FINAL-03`, the application has integrated core logic, file operations, edit operations, and a preferences dialog.
  The View and Tools menus exist in the UI (from `UI-02`) but their actions are not yet functional.
  The `MapViewport` can display the map, but zoom, floor navigation, and visibility toggles for map elements (grid, creatures, etc.) are not yet controllable through the UI menus.
  Toolbars and dockable palettes exist but their visibility cannot be toggled via the View menu.
  View-related settings might be defined in `AppSettings` but are not yet connected to UI actions.
qt6_migration_steps: |
  1.  **Zoom Functionality (`MainWindow` and `MapViewport`):**
      -   Connect "View > Zoom > Zoom In", "Zoom Out", "Zoom Normal" `QAction`s to slots in `MainWindow`.
      -   These slots will call methods on the `MapViewport` instance (e.g., `mapViewport->zoomIn()`, `mapViewport->zoomOut()`, `mapViewport->setZoom(1.0)`).
      -   `MapViewport` needs to implement the actual zoom logic, update its internal zoom factor, and trigger a redraw.
      -   The current zoom level could be displayed in the status bar.
  2.  **Floor Navigation (`MainWindow` and `MapViewport`):**
      -   Connect "Navigate > Floor > Floor X" `QAction`s (or a floor selection widget like `QSpinBox` if `UI-02` created one) to a slot in `MainWindow`.
      -   This slot calls `mapViewport->setCurrentFloor(floorNum)`.
      -   `MapViewport` updates its current floor and triggers a redraw.
      -   The current floor should be displayed in the status bar.
  3.  **Show/Hide Toolbars (`MainWindow`):**
      -   For each toolbar (e.g., Standard, Brushes, Position), connect its corresponding "View > Toolbars > [Toolbar Name]" checkable `QAction::toggled(bool)` signal to a slot.
      -   This slot will call `toolbarInstance->setVisible(bool)` and save the state to `AppSettings`.
      -   Load initial visibility states from `AppSettings` on startup.
  4.  **Show/Hide Palettes (Dock Widgets in `MainWindow`):**
      -   For each palette (e.g., Terrain, Item, Creature - hosted in `QDockWidget`s), connect its "View > Palettes > [Palette Name]" checkable `QAction::toggled(bool)` signal to the `QDockWidget::setVisible(bool)` slot.
      -   Connect the `QDockWidget::visibilityChanged(bool)` signal back to the `QAction::setChecked(bool)` slot to keep them in sync if closed via the dock widget's 'X' button.
      -   Save/load palette visibility states using `AppSettings` (potentially using `QMainWindow::saveState()` and `restoreState()` for the overall dock layout).
  5.  **Map Element Visibility Toggles (`MainWindow` and `MapViewport`):**
      -   For each "View > Show > [Element]" or "Show > [Element]" checkable `QAction` (e.g., Grid, Creatures, Spawns, Lights, Houses, Pathing):
          -   Connect its `toggled(bool)` signal to a slot in `MainWindow`.
          -   This slot updates the corresponding boolean flag in a `MapDrawingOptions` struct (managed by `MapViewport` or `AppContext`).
          -   The slot then calls `mapViewport->updateDrawingOptionsAndRefresh()` or similar to apply changes and trigger a redraw.
          -   The initial checked state of these actions should be loaded from `AppSettings`. The new state should be saved to `AppSettings` when toggled.
  6.  **Common Tools Menu Actions (`MainWindow`):**
      -   **Map Properties:** Connect "Tools > Map Properties" (or "File > Map Properties") to a slot that opens a `MapPropertiesDialog`. This dialog would display information from `AppContext::map()` (description, dimensions) and allow modification, saving changes back to the `Map` object (and making it an undoable action if changes are significant). (Full dialog implementation might be a separate `UI-DIALOGS` task).
      -   **Find Item:** Connect "Tools > Find Item" (or "Search > Find Item") to a slot that opens a `FindItemDialog`. (Full dialog and search logic in `LOGIC-FIND` or similar).
      -   **Other Tools:** Connect other general-purpose tools defined in `menubar.xml` under "Tools" or "Map" to their respective handler slots. These might involve opening dialogs or directly invoking logic on the `AppContext::map()`.
  7.  **Persist View Settings:**
      -   Ensure all toggleable view options (toolbar visibility, palette visibility, map element visibility flags) are saved to `AppSettings` when changed and loaded from `AppSettings` on application startup to restore user preferences.
definition_of_done: |
  - All View menu operations are functional:
    - Zoom In, Zoom Out, Zoom Normal correctly control the map viewport's zoom level.
    - Floor navigation via menu/widget updates the map viewport's current floor.
    - Show/Hide actions for all defined toolbars correctly toggle their visibility and persist state.
    - Show/Hide actions for all defined palettes (dock widgets) correctly toggle their visibility and persist state.
    - Show/Hide actions for map visual elements (Grid, Lights, Creatures, Spawns, Houses, Pathing, etc.) correctly update the map viewport's rendering and persist state.
  - Selected common Tools menu operations are functional:
    - "Map Properties" action opens a dialog displaying basic map information.
    - "Find Item" action opens the Find Item dialog.
  - Relevant view settings (toolbar/palette visibility, map element visibility flags) are persisted using `AppSettings` and restored on application startup.
  - UI elements (e.g., checkable menu items) correctly reflect the current state of these settings.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: |
  Implement the View menu operations and common Tools menu operations for the Qt6 map editor.
  Assume `AppContext` provides `MapViewport& mapViewport`, `AppSettings& appSettings`, and `MainWindow* mainWindow`.
  Menu `QAction`s are already created in `MainWindow` as per `UI-02`. Palette `QDockWidget`s are created as per `UI-PALETTES-ALL`.

  **1. Zoom and Floor Navigation (in `MainWindow` slots, calling `MapViewport` methods):**
     - Implement slots for `zoomInAction`, `zoomOutAction`, `zoomNormalAction` to call `mapViewport.zoomIn()`, `mapViewport.zoomOut()`, `mapViewport.setZoom(1.0)`.
     - Implement a slot for floor change actions/widget to call `mapViewport.setCurrentFloor(newFloor)`.
     - `MapViewport` must implement these methods and refresh itself.

  **2. Toolbar Visibility (in `MainWindow`):**
     - For each toolbar `QAction` (e.g., `viewStandardToolbarAction`):
       - Connect `toggled(bool)` to a slot `onViewToolbarToggled(bool visible, QToolBar* toolbar, AppSettings::Key key)`.
       - Slot: `toolbar->setVisible(visible); appSettings.setBool(key, visible);`.
       - On startup, load visibility from `AppSettings` and apply to toolbars and check actions.

  **3. Palette Visibility (in `MainWindow`):**
     - For each palette `QAction` (e.g., `viewTerrainPaletteAction` pointing to `terrainPaletteDockWidget`):
       - Connect `toggled(bool)` to `paletteDockWidget->setVisible(bool)`.
       - Connect `paletteDockWidget->visibilityChanged(bool)` to `paletteAction->setChecked(bool)`.
       - On startup, load visibility from `AppSettings` (or `QMainWindow::restoreState`) and apply. Save state on close.

  **4. Map Element Visibility Toggles (in `MainWindow` slots, affecting `MapViewport`):**
     - For each `QAction` (e.g., `showGridAction`):
       - Connect `toggled(bool)` to a slot `onShowElementToggled(bool visible, AppSettings::Key key, MapDrawingOptionFlag flag)`.
       - Slot: `appSettings.setBool(key, visible); mapViewport.setDrawingFlag(flag, visible); mapViewport.update();`.
       - `MapViewport` needs a `setDrawingFlag(MapDrawingOptionFlag, bool)` method and use these flags in its paint event.
       - On startup, load settings and apply to actions and `MapViewport`.

  **5. Tools Menu Actions (in `MainWindow`):**
     - `mapPropertiesAction`: Connect `triggered()` to a slot that creates and `exec()`s a `MapPropertiesDialog` (dialog needs to take `AppContext::map()` to display data).
     - `findItemAction`: Connect `triggered()` to a slot that creates and `exec()`s a `FindItemDialog`.

  **6. Settings Persistence:**
     - All toggleable view states (toolbar visibility, palette visibility, map element visibility) must be saved to `AppSettings` when changed and loaded on startup.
