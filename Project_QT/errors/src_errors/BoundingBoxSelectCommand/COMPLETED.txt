===================
Status: COMPLETED
Date: 2024-03-15
Session: 1
Fixes applied: Multiple namespace and inheritance corrections.
Notes:
1. Corrected `BaseCommand` inheritance in `BoundingBoxSelectCommand.h` to use the full namespace `RME::editor_logic::commands::BaseCommand`. This resolved 'base class undefined' and subsequent 'override' and 'identifier not found' errors for BaseCommand methods.
2. Corrected the namespace for `SelectionManager` to `RME::SelectionManager` (based on its definition in `SelectionManager.h`) in both the forward declaration and usages within `BoundingBoxSelectCommand.h` and `BoundingBoxSelectCommand.cpp`.
3. Ensured `Tile` is consistently referred to as `RME::core::Tile`.
These changes are expected to resolve all errors in `BoundingBoxSelectCommand.json`, including cascading errors related to incorrect type recognition (e.g., `RME::RME::core` prefixes) and undeclared members.
