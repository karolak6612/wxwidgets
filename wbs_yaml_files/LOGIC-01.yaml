  In `DRAWING_MODE`, left-clicking on the map canvas with an active brush executes the brush's `draw()` method, creates an `Action` containing the tile changes, and pushes it to the `ActionQueue`. The `MapView` updates immediately. CTRL+Click executes the `undraw()` method.

  Create a controller class (`EditorController`) to manage editor state. In `MapView::mousePressEvent`, if in drawing mode, call a method on the controller (e.g., `controller->performDraw(position, brush)`). This controller method must create an `Action`, execute the appropriate `brush->draw()` or `brush->undraw()`, and push the completed `Action` to the `ActionQueue`.
