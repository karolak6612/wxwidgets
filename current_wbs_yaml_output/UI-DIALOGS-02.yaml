definition_of_done: The "Edit House" and "Towns" dialogs are re-implemented as `QDialog` subclasses. All functionality for creating, editing, removing, and moving houses between towns is ported and functional.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Re-create the `EditHouseDialog` and `EditTownsDialog` using `QDialog`. Replicate all UI elements with their `Qt` equivalents (`QLineEdit`, `QSpinBox`, etc.). Connect UI signals to slots that modify the `House` and `Town` objects within the `Map`, wrapping changes in an `Action`.
