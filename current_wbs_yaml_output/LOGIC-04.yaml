title: Port Waypoint System
input_files:
- waypoints.h/cpp
- editor.cpp (for waypoint brush logic)
- map_display.cpp (for rendering)
dependencies:
- UI-EVENT-01
- CORE-01
definition_of_done: The `Waypoint` and `Waypoints` classes are ported to `mapcore`. The `WaypointBrush` is functional. Waypoints are rendered on the `MapView`.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Port the `Waypoint` and `Waypoints` classes to `mapcore`. Implement rendering of waypoints in `MapView::paintGL`. Port the `WaypointBrush` logic, ensuring it creates an `Action` when waypoints are added or removed.
