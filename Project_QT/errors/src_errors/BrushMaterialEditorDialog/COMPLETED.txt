===================
Status: COMPLETED
Date: 2024-07-24
Session: 2
Fixes applied:
- In `BorderGridEditorWidget` (within `BrushMaterialEditorDialog.h`): Reordered member variable declarations (`m_selectedPosition`, `m_borderItems`, `m_cellSize`, `m_gridRect`) to appear before their potential use in inline methods, fixing an undeclared identifier error for `m_selectedPosition`.
- In `BrushMaterialEditorDialog.h`: Added forward declarations for `RME::core::assets::MaterialManager` and `RME::core::assets::ItemDatabase` to correctly type member variables and constructor parameters.
- In `BrushMaterialEditorDialog.h`: Changed `public slots:` to `public Q_SLOTS:` and `private slots:` to `private Q_SLOTS:` for QT_NO_KEYWORDS compliance.

Notes:
The primary errors in `BrushMaterialEditorDialog.json` were related to:
1. Undeclared identifier `m_selectedPosition` in `BorderGridEditorWidget` due to declaration order.
2. Type resolution issues for `MaterialManager` due to missing forward declaration.
3. Incorrect Qt `slots` keyword usage.
4. Other syntax errors (e.g., line 88, end of file) which were likely cascading from the above.

The applied fixes directly address these core issues. It's expected that these changes resolve all reported errors for this file.
