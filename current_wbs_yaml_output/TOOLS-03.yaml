definition_of_done: A non-modal, dockable "Properties" widget is created. When an item is selected on the map, this widget is populated with its properties. Editing a property and clicking "Apply" creates an undoable `Action`.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Create a `PropertiesWidget` inheriting `QWidget`. Place it in a `QDockWidget`. In the `Selection` class, add a Qt signal `selectionChanged(Item*)`. Connect this signal to a slot in `PropertiesWidget` that populates the UI with the item's data. Connect the Apply button to a slot that creates and pushes an `Action`.
