  Mouse events (clicks, drags, wheel) on `MapView` are correctly translated to map coordinates and floor levels. The application state can switch between `DRAWING_MODE` and `SELECTION_MODE`. All keydown events (`OnKeyDown`) for camera and brush control are functional.

  In the `MapView` class, override `mousePressEvent`, `mouseMoveEvent`, `mouseReleaseEvent`, and `wheelEvent`. Re-implement the coordinate translation logic from `MapCanvas::ScreenToMap`. Implement a state machine or enum in a controller class to manage `DRAWING` vs `SELECTION` modes, mirroring the logic in `gui.cpp`. Connect `QAction`s to toggle these modes.
