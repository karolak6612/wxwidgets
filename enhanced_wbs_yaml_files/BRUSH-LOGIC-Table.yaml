    description: Defines 'TableBrush' (inherits 'Brush'). Includes structures for 'TableType' (item ID and chance) and 'TableNode' for different alignments.
  - file_path: wxwidgets/table_brush.cpp
    description: Implements 'TableBrush'. Handles loading definitions from XML. 'doTables' method calculates and applies the correct table segment based on adjacent table pieces.

current_functionality_summary: |
  The 'TableBrush' draws table-like items, automatically selecting the correct segment (vertical, horizontal, ends, alone) based on adjacent table pieces. Definitions are loaded from XML.
qt6_migration_steps: |
  1. Define `mapcore::TableBrush` class inheriting from `mapcore::Brush`.
  2. Store current table brush definition (item IDs for alignments) loaded from `MaterialManager`.
  3. Implement `apply()`:
     - If erasing: Remove table item. Trigger updates for neighbors.
     - If drawing: Implement 'doTables' logic: Analyze neighbors to select correct table segment item ID. Place item.
     - Record changes for undo.
definition_of_done: |
  - `mapcore::TableBrush` is implemented.
  - Table brush definitions are loaded and used.
  - Auto-alignment logic correctly places table segments.
  - Operations are undoable.
  - Unit tests for table placement and alignment pass.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: |
  Port `TableBrush` from `wxwidgets/table_brush.cpp/h` to `mapcore::TableBrush`.
  1. Header: `mapcore::TableBrush : public mapcore::Brush`. Store current table definition (from `MaterialManager`).
  2. Source: Implement `apply()`. Core logic is similar to `CarpetBrush` or `WallBrush` - check neighbors to determine which table segment item ID to use from the definition. Place/remove item. All changes via `EditorControllerInterface`.
