title: Implement Regression Test Suite for I/O
input_files:
- Sample .otbm
- .otb
- .xml
- .dat
- .spr files.
dependencies:
- CORE-03
definition_of_done: A suite of regression tests is created. Each test loads a sample legacy data file (`.otbm`, `.otb`, etc.), saves it back out using the new system, and performs a binary comparison or structural validation to ensure a byte-for-byte or logically equivalent output.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Using the `io` module from `mapcore`, write a series of tests that load a provided set of sample map and asset files. After loading, immediately save the data back to a temporary file. Compare the temporary file with the original to ensure data integrity and format correctness.
