Fixes applied:
- Changed all instances of `emit` to `Q_EMIT` in `BrushManagerService.cpp` to align with QT_NO_KEYWORDS.
Notes:
Reviewed `BrushManagerService.h` and `BrushManagerService.cpp` against errors in `BrushManagerService.json`.

1.  **`emit` to `Q_EMIT`**: All signal emissions in `BrushManagerService.cpp` were updated. This was the primary actionable code change.

2.  **Phantom/Outdated Errors in JSON**:
    *   `'RME::std::make_unique'`, `'RME::std::move'`, `'RME::std::unique_ptr'`: The current source code correctly uses `std::make_unique`, `std::move`. The `RME::std::` prefix in the error log is inconsistent with the reviewed code.
    *   `'BrushManagerService': is not a class or namespace name` / `'RME::RME::core::BrushManagerService'`: The class `BrushManagerService` is correctly defined, inherits `QObject`, and includes `<QObject>`. The `Q_OBJECT` macro is present. These errors, especially the double `RME::` prefix, are likely artifacts from the error generation process.
    *   `'Square': illegal qualified name / undeclared identifier`: `BrushShape::Square` is used correctly, with `BrushShape` enum defined in `BrushEnums.h` (included via `BrushSettings.h`).
    *   `'RME::RME::core::CreatureBrush': expected an expression instead of a type`: The current code uses `std::make_unique<CreatureBrush>()` or `std::make_unique<RME::core::GroundBrush>()`, which are correctly namespaced based on includes. The double `RME::RME::` is an artifact.
    *   Header syntax errors (line 67, 101 in .h): The reported lines in `BrushManagerService.h` are syntactically correct in the reviewed code.

Conclusion: After changing `emit` to `Q_EMIT`, the `BrushManagerService` component appears to align with Qt6/C++17 guidelines. The other significant errors reported in the JSON log do not correspond to the current state of the source files and are likely phantoms or outdated.
