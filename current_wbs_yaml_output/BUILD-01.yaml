title: Finalize CMake Build System
input_files:
- CMakeLists.txt from FINAL-02
dependencies:
- FINAL-02
definition_of_done: The root CMake build system is finalized. It includes platform-specific logic, dependency finding (`find_package` for Qt6, zlib), setting rpaths for macOS/Linux, and defines build configurations (Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo).
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Refine the root `CMakeLists.txt`. Use `find_package(Qt6 REQUIRED Widgets Gui OpenGL)` to locate Qt. Add conditional logic for platform-specific compiler flags and library paths. Implement `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH` for macOS and Linux builds.
