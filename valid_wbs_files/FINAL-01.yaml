title: Integrate Core Map Logic with Main Qt UI
original_input_files:
  - "Ported `Map` class and related logic from `CORE-03`"
  - "Ported `ActionQueue` / `QUndoStack` from `CORE-04`"
  - "Ported `SelectionManager` and `ClipboardManager` from `CORE-05`"
  - "Basic Qt Main Window shell from `UI-01`"
  - "Basic Qt Map Viewport shell from `RENDER-01`"
  - "Asset loading system from `CORE-02`"
analyzed_input_files:
  - file_path: "mapcore::Map (from CORE-03)"
    description: |
      The C++ class representing the map's data structure, including tiles, items, creatures, spawns, houses, etc.
      It provides methods for loading, saving (to be fully implemented later), modifying, and querying map data.
      This task will make this data accessible and manipulable through the UI.
  - file_path: "mapcore::ActionQueue / QUndoStack (from CORE-04)"
    description: |
      The system for managing undo/redo operations. UI actions that modify the map
      (e.g., drawing, pasting, deleting) must be wrapped in commands and pushed onto this stack.
      This task will ensure basic UI operations are correctly registered with the undo system.
  - file_path: "mapcore::SelectionManager (from CORE-05)"
    description: |
      Manages the set of currently selected map elements. The UI needs to interact with this manager
      to reflect selections visually and to inform core logic about what elements operations should apply to.
  - file_path: "mapcore::ClipboardManager (from CORE-05)"
    description: |
      Handles copy, cut, and paste operations by serializing/deserializing map data.
      UI actions for copy/cut/paste need to be wired to this manager.
  - file_path: "qtui::MainWindow (from UI-01)"
    description: |
      The basic Qt main window shell, containing menus, toolbars, and a central area for the map viewport.
      This task will connect its menu actions (e.g., File > Open, Edit > Undo) to the core logic.
  - file_path: "qtui::MapViewport (from RENDER-01)"
    description: |
      The Qt widget responsible for rendering the map. It needs to be provided with data from the `mapcore::Map`
      and reflect updates, selections, and viewport changes (zoom, scroll).
  - file_path: "mapcore::AssetManager (from CORE-02)"
    description: |
      The system responsible for loading all game assets (items, creatures, sprites).
      The UI (e.g., File > Open) will trigger asset loading via this manager before loading a map file.

current_functionality_summary: |
  At this stage, core map logic (`mapcore::Map`, `Tile`, `Item`, actions, selection, clipboard, asset loading) has been ported and exists as a library (`mapcore`).
  A basic Qt UI shell (`qtui::MainWindow`) and a map viewport widget (`qtui::MapViewport`) also exist but are not yet fully connected to the `mapcore` functionalities.
  Data cannot yet be loaded, displayed interactively, or modified through the UI in an integrated manner.
  This task is the first step in bridging the `mapcore` library with the `qtui` application.
qt6_migration_steps: |
  1.  **Application Context/Manager:**
      -   Establish a central application context class (e.g., `AppContext` or enhance `qtui::Application`) to manage instances of key `mapcore` objects like `AssetManager`, `Map`, `QUndoStack`, `SelectionManager`, `ClipboardManager`.
      -   This context will provide access to these core services for different UI components.
  2.  **Asset Loading Integration:**
      -   Implement the `File > Open Client Data` (or similar) menu action in `qtui::MainWindow`.
      -   This action should trigger `AppContext::assetManager().loadAllAssets(dataPath, clientVersion)`.
      -   Provide UI feedback during asset loading (e.g., progress dialog or status bar updates).
  3.  **Map Loading and Display:**
      -   Implement the `File > Open Map` menu action in `qtui::MainWindow`.
      -   This action should use `AppContext::map().load(filePath)` (assuming `load` is part of `Map`'s interface from `CORE-03`).
      -   Upon successful map loading, the `qtui::MapViewport` must be notified and provided with a reference to the `mapcore::Map` object (or relevant data views/interfaces) to render.
      -   Implement basic rendering in `MapViewport` to display loaded tiles and items (details in `RENDER-01` refinement).
  4.  **Undo/Redo UI Integration:**
      -   Connect `Edit > Undo` and `Edit > Redo` menu actions in `qtui::MainWindow` to the `QUndoStack::undo()` and `QUndoStack::redo()` slots held by `AppContext`.
      -   Update the enabled state of these menu items based on `QUndoStack::canUndoChanged` and `QUndoStack::canRedoChanged` signals.
  5.  **Selection UI Integration (Basic):**
      -   When the user interacts with `qtui::MapViewport` (e.g., mouse clicks - to be detailed in `RENDER-01`/`LOGIC-01`), these events should eventually call `AppContext::selectionManager().{add,remove,clear}` methods.
      -   The `SelectionManager` changes (now wrapped in `QUndoCommand`s) should be pushed to the `QUndoStack`.
      -   The `MapViewport` should visually indicate the current selection (details in `RENDER-01`).
  6.  **Copy/Paste UI Integration (Basic):**
      -   Connect `Edit > Copy`, `Edit > Cut`, `Edit > Paste` menu actions.
      -   `Copy`: Calls `AppContext::clipboardManager().copySelection(appContext.selectionManager(), appContext.map())`.
      -   `Cut`: Calls `AppContext::clipboardManager().cutSelection(appContext.selectionManager(), appContext.map(), appContext.undoStack())`.
      -   `Paste`: Calls `AppContext::clipboardManager().paste(appContext.map(), currentMouseMapPosition, appContext.undoStack())`.
  7.  **Basic Application State Updates:**
      -   The main window title should reflect the currently loaded map name and its modified state (e.g., using `*` if `map.hasChanged()`).
      -   Status bar updates for current map coordinates (from `MapViewport` interaction).
  8.  **Error Handling:** Implement basic error dialogs (e.g., using `QMessageBox`) for failures in loading assets or maps.
definition_of_done: |
  - The Qt application can successfully load game assets (items, creatures, sprites via `AssetManager`) triggered by a UI action.
  - A map file (.otbm) can be opened via a `File > Open Map` UI action, and its content is loaded into the `mapcore::Map` object.
  - The `qtui::MapViewport` displays a basic visual representation of the loaded map data (tiles and items).
  - Core undo/redo actions (`Edit > Undo`, `Edit > Redo`) are functional and correctly operate on the `QUndoStack`.
  - Basic selection operations initiated from the UI (e.g., selecting a tile conceptually) are registered with the `SelectionManager` and are undoable.
  - Basic copy, cut, and paste actions initiated from the UI are functional, using the `ClipboardManager` and are undoable.
  - The main window title displays the current map name and an indicator for unsaved changes.
  - The application remains stable during these basic integrated operations.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: |
  You are to integrate core C++ map logic (`mapcore` library) with a basic Qt6 UI shell.
  Assume `mapcore` provides:
  - `AssetManager` for loading game data.
  - `Map` class for holding and manipulating map data.
  - `QUndoStack` (or equivalent `ActionQueue`) for undo/redo.
  - `SelectionManager` for handling selected map elements.
  - `ClipboardManager` for copy/cut/paste.

  Assume `qtui` provides:
  - `Application` (main Qt application class).
  - `MainWindow` (main window with menus like File, Edit).
  - `MapViewport` (a widget for displaying the map).

  **Tasks:**
  1.  **Create/Use `AppContext`:** Establish a central class (`AppContext`) to own and provide access to `AssetManager`, `Map`, `QUndoStack`, `SelectionManager`, `ClipboardManager` instances.
  2.  **Implement Asset Loading:**
      -   Connect a `File > Load Client Data` menu action in `MainWindow` to `AppContext::assetManager().loadAllAssets(...)`.
  3.  **Implement Map Loading & Display:**
      -   Connect `File > Open Map` menu action to `AppContext::map().load(...)`.
      -   After successful load, pass the `mapcore::Map*` to `MapViewport` and trigger a redraw. (Viewport should render basic tile/item appearance).
  4.  **Wire Undo/Redo:**
      -   Connect `Edit > Undo` menu action to `QUndoStack::undo()`.
      -   Connect `Edit > Redo` menu action to `QUndoStack::redo()`.
      -   Update menu item enabled states based on `QUndoStack::canUndoChanged` and `QUndoStack::canRedoChanged`.
  5.  **Basic Selection Hookup:**
      -   Conceptually, when `MapViewport` detects a selection attempt (e.g., mouse click), it should call `AppContext::selectionManager().selectObject(object, tile)` which in turn creates a `SelectCommand` and pushes it to the `QUndoStack`.
      -   `MapViewport` should observe selection changes (e.g., via signals from `SelectionManager` or by querying it) to visually highlight selected elements.
  6.  **Basic Copy/Paste Hookup:**
      -   Connect `Edit > Copy` to `AppContext::clipboardManager().copySelection(...)`.
      -   Connect `Edit > Cut` to `AppContext::clipboardManager().cutSelection(...)`.
      -   Connect `Edit > Paste` to `AppContext::clipboardManager().paste(...)`, passing the current target map position.
  7.  **Window Title & Status:**
      -   Update `MainWindow` title with map name and modified status (`*`).
      -   Display basic map coordinates in a status bar.
  8.  Use `QMessageBox` for basic error reporting.
  Focus on the connections and data flow, not complex UI details or rendering specifics beyond basic display.
