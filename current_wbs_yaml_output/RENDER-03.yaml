definition_of_done: '`MapView` creates and manages a texture atlas for all game sprites. It correctly renders items and creatures from the map data models by drawing textured quads.'
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Create a `TextureManager` class. In `MapView`, during initialization, use the `TextureManager` to build a texture atlas from the loaded sprite data. In `paintGL`, bind the atlas and draw sprites using appropriate texture coordinates.
