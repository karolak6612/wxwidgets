definition_of_done: The application fully replaces `g_settings` with a new `Settings` singleton class that uses `QSettings` for persistence. All editor options from the legacy system are migrated and functional.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Create a new singleton class, `AppSettings`. Use `QSettings` as the storage backend. Port all key-value pairs from `Config::Key` enum. Replace all calls to `g_settings` throughout the new codebase with calls to the `AppSettings` singleton.
