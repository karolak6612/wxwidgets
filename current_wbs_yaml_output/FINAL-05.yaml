title: Port About and Welcome Dialogs
input_files:
- about_window.h/cpp
- welcome_dialog.h/cpp
dependencies:
- UI-01
definition_of_done: The "About" and "Welcome" dialogs are re-implemented using `QDialog`. The easter-egg games in `about_window.cpp` (`Tetris`, `Snake`) are to be ported as simple `QWidget`-based games.
boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: Re-create the `AboutDialog` and `WelcomeDialog` as Qt dialogs. The embedded games should be re-implemented within simple `QWidget`s using `QPainter` for rendering and `QTimer` for the game loop.
