Notes: Corrected the usage of `Position` in `Project_QT/src/core/actions/appundocommand.h` to `RME::Position` to match its definition in `Position.h`. The `getChangedPositions()` method now returns `QList<RME::Position>`. This is expected to resolve all 'undeclared identifier' and subsequent template argument errors for `Position` in this file.
