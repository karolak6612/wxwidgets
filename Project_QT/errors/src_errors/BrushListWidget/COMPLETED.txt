===================
Status: COMPLETED
Date: 2024-03-15
Session: 1
Fixes applied: 3 (logical fix types)
Notes:
1. In `BrushListWidget.h`:
   - Changed `public slots:` to `public Q_SLOTS:`.
   - Changed `signals:` to `Q_SIGNALS:`.
   (These ensure compliance with `QT_NO_KEYWORDS`).
2. In `BrushListWidget.cpp`:
   - Added `#include <QVariant>` for `QVariant::fromValue`.
   - Changed `emit` to `Q_EMIT`.

These changes are expected to resolve all reported errors in `BrushListWidget.json`. Cascading errors in the .cpp file (like 'identifier not found' for QListWidget methods or members) should be fixed once the header is correctly parsed and inheritance is established.
