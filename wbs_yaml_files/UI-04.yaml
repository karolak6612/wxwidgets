  A `Minimap` widget is created as a `QDockWidget`. It renders a top-down view of the current floor using the same sprite data as `MapView`. Clicks on the minimap navigate the main `MapView`. Caching must be implemented for performance.

  Create a `MinimapWidget` (`QWidget`). In its `paintEvent`, render a scaled-down representation of the `Map` by drawing colored pixels for each tile based on its `minimapColor`. Override `mousePressEvent` to calculate the clicked map coordinate and emit a signal to navigate `MapView`.
