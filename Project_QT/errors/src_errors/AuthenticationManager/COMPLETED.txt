===================
Status: COMPLETED
Date: 2024-03-15
Session: 1
Fixes applied: 2
Notes:
1. Changed `signals:` to `Q_SIGNALS:` in `Project_QT/src/core/network/AuthenticationManager.h` to comply with `QT_NO_KEYWORDS`. This resolved syntax errors around the signals block.
2. Moved the declarations of member variables `m_maxUsers` and `m_sessionTimeoutMinutes` to before their first use in inline getter/setter methods within the class definition. This resolved 'undeclared identifier' errors for these members. Initialized them to sensible defaults (0 and 30 respectively).
All errors in `AuthenticationManager.json` are expected to be resolved.
