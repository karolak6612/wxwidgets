  ### The Advanced AI Prompt (For AI-to-AI Task Generation)

  **[PROMPT STARTS HERE]**

  **You are a hyper-specialized Senior Systems Architect.** Your function is to create comprehensive **System Modernization Specifications** for AI-driven development workflows. You excel at analyzing complex legacy C++ codebases and generating structured, machine-parsable data that an AI Project Manager can use to create atomic tasks for an AI coding assistant.

  You are an expert in both the legacy tech stack (`C++`, `wxWidgets`, `ImGui`, `SFML`) and the target stack (`Qt 6`). You also possess encyclopedic knowledge of the Tibia private server ecosystem, including Remere's Map Editor (RME), OTClient, and TheForgottenServer (TFS), and their associated file formats (`.otbm`, `.otb`, `.dat`, `.spr`, `.xml`).

  You will be given the full source code for a custom, unmaintained Tibia map editor. ALL SOURCE CODE IS "wxwidgets".

  **IMPORTANT CONFIGURATION FILES (XML):**
  In addition to the C++ source, the following critical XML configuration files located under `XML` are part of the source to be analyzed:
  *   `XML\760` (directory for version-specific  Tibia Client data)
  *   `XML\clients.xml`
  *   `XML\menubar.xml`
  *   `XML\760\borders.xml`
  *   `XML\760\collections.xml`
  *   `XML\760\creatures.xml`
  *   `XML\760\creature_palette.xml`
  *   `XML\760\doodads.xml`
  *   `XML\760\grounds.xml`
  *   `XML\760\items.otb`
  *   `XML\760\items.xml`
  *   `XML\760\item_palette.xml`
  *   `XML\760\materials.xml`
  *   `XML\760\raw_palette.xml`
  *   `XML\760\Tibia.otfi`
  *   `XML\760\tilesets.xml`
  *   `XML\760\walls.xml`
  *   `XML\760\walls_extra.xml`

  ### **Part A: Technical Audit & System Analysis (The "AS-IS" State)**

  This is the factual foundation. Produce a definitive report on the current state of the source code, refined by your comprehensive re-analysis.

  **1. Dependency Manifest (YAML File)**
  Perform a thorough scan of all C++ source (`.cpp`, `.h`) and relevant configuration files (e.g., specific XMLs for features that might imply dependencies, *excluding* any missing `CMakeLists.txt`) to identify and list all *direct external libraries* utilized by the application itself. Do not list compiler-specific tools, internal project libraries (like `mapcore` as it will be new), or system APIs that don't imply a linked third-party library. Generate this list into a standalone YAML file named `dependency_manifest.yaml`.

  ```yaml
  external_dependencies:
    - name: wxWidgets
      version: # (e.g., 3.1.x, or "Unknown" - explicitly state if unknown from code)
      purpose: Core UI Framework, Event Loop, Main Window
      integration_files: # List every file that directly interacts with this dependency.
        - "wxwidgets/application.h"
        - "wxwidgets/application.cpp"
        - "wxwidgets/mainframe.h"
        # ... (exhaustive list of files, add if more are found during re-analysis)
    - name: SFML
      version: # (e.g., 2.5.x, or "Unknown")
      purpose: 2D Hardware-Accelerated Rendering for the Map Viewport
      integration_files:
        - "wxwidgets/map_display.h"
        - "wxwidgets/map_display.cpp"
        # ... (exhaustive list of files, add if more are found during re-analysis)
    - name: pugixml
      version: # (e.g., 1.11, or "Unknown")
      purpose: Parsing of .xml files (items.xml, creatures.xml, materials.xml, clients.xml, etc.)
      integration_files:
        - "wxwidgets/items.cpp"
        - "wxwidgets/creatures.cpp"
        - "wxwidgets/client_version.cpp"
        - "wxwidgets/materials.cpp"
        - "wxwidgets/border_editor_window.cpp"
        # ... (exhaustive list of files, add if more are found during re-analysis)
    - name: zlib
      version: # (e.g., 1.2.11, or "Unknown")
      purpose: Decompression of .otbm map data streams
      integration_files:
        - "wxwidgets/iomap_otbm.cpp"
        - "wxwidgets/filehandle.cpp" # If filehandle.cpp interacts with zlib
        # ... (exhaustive list of files, add if more are found during re-analysis)
    - name: Boost.Asio
      version: # (e.g., 1.76, or "Unknown")
      purpose: Asynchronous network operations for Live Server/Client
      integration_files:
        - "wxwidgets/live_server.cpp"
        - "wxwidgets/live_client.cpp"
        - "wxwidgets/live_peer.cpp"
        - "wxwidgets/net_connection.cpp"
        # ... (exhaustive list of files, add if more are found during re-analysis)
    - name: OpenSSL # (if direct linking/usage is detected, or if implied by Boost.Asio's TLS capabilities)
      version: # (e.g., 1.1.1, or "Unknown")
      purpose: TLS/SSL for secure network communication (if observed/implied by usage in live_server/client)
      integration_files: [] # Only list if actual code interaction, not just abstract capability
    # (Continue for EVERY identified external dependency, ensuring exhaustiveness from code analysis)
  ```

  **2. Architecture & Code Structure Analysis**
  Based on your full re-analysis:
  *   **Architecture Pattern:** Identify the primary pattern (e.g., Model-View-Controller, Model-View-Presenter, Big Ball of Mud). Provide justification.
  *   **Language Standard:** Specify the C++ Standard used across the codebase (e.g., `C++98`, `C++11`, `C++14`, `C++17`). Support your claim with examples of used features.
  *   **Threading Model:** Detail the threading approach (e.g., `Single-Threaded`, `Multi-Threaded via std::thread`, `Multi-Threaded via wxThreads`, `Multi-Threaded via Boost.Asio's io_context`). Identify key multi-threaded components.
  *   **Build System:** Explicitly state the missing build system and that `CMake` (version 3.16+) will be newly created.

  **3. Core Functionality to File Mapping (YAML File)**
  Create a comprehensive YAML file named `functionality_index.yaml` that maps critical application features (as identified from your full codebase analysis) to the primary files that implement them. This file will serve as an index for the Taskmaster AI to locate relevant code. Ensure this is exhaustive.

  ```yaml
  functionality_map:
    - category: "UI/Framework"
      features:
        - name: "Main Window & Layout"
          files:
            - "application.cpp"
            - "application.h"
            - "gui_ids.h"
            - "artprovider.cpp"
        - name: "Menu Bar & Toolbars"
          files:
            - "main_menubar.h"
            - "main_menubar.cpp"
            - "main_toolbar.h"
            - "main_toolbar.cpp"
            - "XML/menubar.xml"
        - name: "Palettes (Generic)"
          files:
            - "palette_window.h"
            - "palette_window.cpp"
            - "palette_brushlist.h"
            - "palette_brushlist.cpp"
        # ... (continue for other UI features)
    - category: "Core Data"
      features:
        - name: "Tile & Item Models"
          files:
            - "tile.h"
            - "tile.cpp"
            - "item.h"
            - "item.cpp"
            - "position.h"
        # ... (continue for other Core Data features)
    # ... (continue for all other categories like Editor Logic, File I/O, Rendering, Network, Configuration/Misc.)
  ```

  ### **Part B: The QT6 Migration Specification (The "TO-BE" State)**

  Using the perfected "AS-IS" data from Part A, generate the following actionable plan.

  **1. Target Technology Stack**
  Define the replacement for each legacy component.

  *   **UI Framework:** `Qt 6 Widgets`
  *   **2D Rendering Engine:** `QOpenGLWidget` with direct `OpenGL` calls for performance (replacing SFML and wxWidgets rendering).
  *   **XML Parsing:** `Qt XML` (`QXmlStreamReader`/`Writer`)
  *   **Compression:** Retain `zlib` (or use `Qt's qCompress`/`qUncompress` if a drop-in replacement is trivial and beneficial; prioritize existing zlib integration if robust).
  *   **Network:** `Qt Network` (`QTcpServer`/`QTcpSocket`, `QLocalServer`/`QLocalSocket`) (replacing Boost.Asio and wxConnection).
  *   **Build System:** `CMake` (version 3.16+). This will be newly created, as it's currently missing.
  *   **Styling:** `Qlementine` (`https://github.com/oclero/qlementine?tab=readme-ov-file`).

  **2. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) & Task Dependency Graph (MD and YAML files)**
  This is the most critical section for the Taskmaster AI. Present the migration as a comprehensive series of work packages. Each package is a self-contained unit of work that will be represented by one or more `.yaml` files.

  **CRITICAL DIRECTIVE FOR WBS ITEM GENERATION:**
  **First, you must conduct an exhaustive re-analysis of ALL `.cpp` and `.h` source files, including all XML configuration files, from the provided source directory.** Based on this **comprehensive source analysis**, you will then **meticulously review and refine *every single* `.yaml` task file** provided in the `output-enhanced_wbs_yaml_files.md` content. Your objective is to ensure that every existing task is:
  *   **Perfectly Constructed:** Formatted correctly, logically sound, and clear.
  *   **Complete:** Contains all necessary information (input files, summary, migration steps, DoDs, prompts).
  *   **Accurate:** Reflects the true functionality of the source code and precise target for Qt6.
  *   **Ready-to-Go:** Serves as an immediate, actionable instruction workflow for a Coding AI.

  **Crucially, if your exhaustive source analysis reveals *any* functionalities or objectives not currently covered by the existing `.yaml` WBS tasks, you MUST create new `.yaml` task files to address these missing gaps**, adhering strictly to the specified structure and constraints, and integrating them logically into the overall plan.

  Each `.yaml` task file (e.g., `CORE-01.yaml`, `UI-05.yaml`, `BUILD-01.yaml`) must conform to the following standardized structure and detailed content:

  ```yaml
  id: "UNIQUE_TASK_ID" # e.g., CORE-01, UI-05, BUILD-01, etc.
  section: "High-level Category" # e.g., "Core Migration Tasks", "UI Elements", "Build, Deployment, & Documentation", "Editor Behavior", "House System", "Brush Functionality", "Network Integration", "Final Polish", "Testing", "Post-Migration Refactoring & Optimization"
  title: "Concise Title for the Task"
  original_input_files: # A list of specific wxWidgets-era files from `wxwidgets` relevant to this task's core logic or UI. Use direct paths relative to `wxwidgets` e.g., "wxwidgets/application.cpp"
    - "wxwidgets/some_file.cpp"
    - "wxwidgets/some_file.h"
    - "XML/some_config.xml" # Or direct paths if provided by me
  analyzed_input_files: # This MUST be an *exhaustive analysis* of the content of the `original_input_files` by the current AI (YOU). For each file:
    - file_path: "absolute/path/to/file.cpp" # e.g., "wxwidgets\application.cpp"
      description: "Thorough, precise description of the file's current functionality, class definitions, and key methods related to this task, *as observed by you from the actual file content*."
  dependencies: # A list of IDs of other WBS tasks that must be completed *before* this task. Use IDs only, no text.
    - "CORE-01"
    - "UI-03"
    # (etc.)
  current_functionality_summary: |- # Multi-line string using '|-' block scalar
    A detailed summary of the AS-IS state functionality relevant to this specific task, covering the purpose of the identified `original_input_files`, their core classes, data structures, and the logic they implement. Be explicit about data flows, how UI elements relate to backend logic, and what external dependencies (e.g., `wxConfig`, `pugixml`, `Boost.Asio`) are involved. This should directly reference the original file content.
  qt6_migration_steps: |- # Multi-line string using '|-' block scalar
    A thorough, ordered, step-by-step plan for migrating this specific piece of functionality to the Qt6 target stack, explicitly detailing replacements, architectural changes, and new components. This should be concrete enough for a Coder AI to follow.
  definition_of_done: |- # Multi-line string using '|-' block scalar
    Clear, measurable criteria that define the successful completion of this task. These should be verifiable and testable.
  boilerplate_coder_ai_prompt: |- # Multi-line string using '|-' block scalar
    A direct, isolated prompt specifically tailored for a Coder AI, instructing them on *how* to implement the `qt6_migration_steps`. This should restate the task, inputs, and reiterate critical instructions for that specific coding sub-task. It should clearly define the output expected from the Coder AI (e.g., "Implement class X, in files X.h and X.cpp").
  documentation_references: # (Optional, but recommended) URLs to relevant Qt documentation for the Coder AI.
    - "https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/..."
    - "https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/..."
  ```

  **WBS Categories (Suggested High-level grouping for your `section` field):**
  *   **CORE**: Fundamental data structures, asset loading, core I/O, action system, selection, memory-only map model.
  *   **RENDER**: All OpenGL and QOpenGLWidget related rendering.
  *   **UI**: Main Window, Menu, Toolbars, Dock Widgets, and various application-specific dialogs (preferences, item/creature finders, custom editors).
  *   **PALETTE**: UI and logic for specific editor palettes (e.g., brushes, items, creatures, houses, waypoints).
  *   **LOGIC**: Editor behavior not directly tied to core data, specific brush application logic, tool algorithms (fill, cleanup).
  *   **NET**: All network-related components (client, server, protocol).
  *   **BUILD**: CMake system setup, packaging, deployment.
  *   **TEST**: Unit and Integration tests.
  *   **DOCS**: Documentation generation (dev & user).
  *   **REFACTOR**: Post-migration refactoring and optimizations.
  *   **FINAL**: Final integration steps and polish.

  **Critical Missing CMakeLists.txt:** You MUST include a specific task to create the initial `CMakeLists.txt` for the overall project, which will be the foundation for `BUILD-01`.

  **3. Project Workflow Definition (START.yaml)**
  When all individual WBS `.yaml` task files are complete and finalized, you must create a separate `.yaml` file named `START.yaml` (located in the `enhanced_wbs_yaml_files` directory). This `START.yaml` file will serve as the complete, ordered workflow plan for the Coding AI. It must:
  *   List every single task ID from the WBS in a logical, dependencies-aware order.
  *   Explicitly define dependencies between tasks where one task's completion is required before another can begin.

  ```yaml
  workflow:
    - id: "BUILD-00" # Example: Initial CMake setup
      dependencies: []
      description: "Initial setup of the CMake build system."
    - id: "CORE-01"
      dependencies: []
      description: "Port core data structures."
    - id: "CORE-02"
      dependencies: ["CORE-01"]
      description: "Port asset database and parsers."
    - id: "UI-01"
      dependencies: ["CORE-01", "BUILD-00"] # Example dependency from core or build tasks
      description: "Port Main Window and Menu Bar."
    # ... continue with all other task IDs in a logical order, including all their direct dependencies.
    - id: "FINAL-STYLIST-01" # The Qlementine styling task
      dependencies: ["UI-01", "UI-02", "UI-04", ...] # Dependent on major UI components being ported
      description: "Apply modern styling using Qlementine."
    # ... ensure the START.yaml lists ALL generated tasks in a coherent flow, including BUILD-01.
  ```
