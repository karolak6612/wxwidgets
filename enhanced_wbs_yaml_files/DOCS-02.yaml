title: Create Initial User Manual
original_input_files: '`main_menubar.xml` (for features)'
analyzed_input_files:
- wxwidgets/main_menubar.h
- wxwidgets/main_menubar.cpp
- XML/menubar.xml (Fetched via URL)
dependencies:
- FINAL-04
current_functionality_summary: The `menubar.xml` file (content successfully fetched) defines the complete menu hierarchy, item names, hotkeys, and help strings for the application. The `main_menubar.h/.cpp` files load this XML to dynamically construct the menu bar and map menu items to internal ActionIDs. The user manual task involves documenting these features for end-users.
qt6_migration_steps: |-
  1. Review the list of `ActionID` enums in `wxwidgets/main_menubar.h` to cross-reference actions with their internal identifiers.
  2. Parse the fetched `menubar.xml` content to extract the detailed menu structure: top-level menus, sub-menus, specific item names, their stated hotkeys, and help tooltips. This defines the user-visible feature set.
  3. Based on the extracted features, outline the structure of the user manual (e.g., `UserManual.md`). Suggested sections:
     - "1. Introduction": Brief overview of the map editor.
     - "2. Installation":
       - Windows (MSI from `BUILD-02`).
       - macOS (DMG from `BUILD-02`).
       - Linux (.deb from `BUILD-02`).
     - "3. Getting Started - UI Overview":
       - Main Window (from `UI-01`, `UI-02`).
       - Menu Bar and Toolbars (from `UI-02`, using actual structure from `menubar.xml`).
       - Map Viewport (from `RENDER-01`).
       - Palettes (Brush, Creature, House, etc. from `UI-PALETTE-*` tasks).
       - Status Bar (from `FINAL-06`).
     - "4. Basic Operations":
       - Creating, Opening, Saving Maps (File menu actions from `menubar.xml`).
       - Undo/Redo (Edit menu actions from `menubar.xml`).
     - "5. Drawing Tools (Brushes)":
       - Overview of different brush types (Terrain, Doodad, Item, Creature, House, etc. - from palette tasks and material definitions).
       - How to select and use brushes.
       - Brush size/shape options (if applicable, from UI related to `GuiManager`).
     - "6. Editing Features":
       - Selection modes (from `SELECT_MODE_*` actions in `menubar.xml`).
       - Copy, Cut, Paste (Edit menu from `menubar.xml`).
       - Find/Replace Items (Tools/Search menu from `menubar.xml`).
       - Map Properties & Statistics (Map menu from `menubar.xml`).
     - "7. Viewing Options":
       - Zooming, Floor navigation (View/Navigate menu from `menubar.xml`).
       - Show/Hide various elements (grid, creatures, spawns, lights - View/Show menu from `menubar.xml`).
     - "8. Advanced Tools (if applicable)":
       - Borderize, Randomize (Map/Edit menu from `menubar.xml`).
       - Map Cleanup operations (Map menu from `menubar.xml`).
     - "(Optional) Appendix: Keyboard Shortcuts" (extracted from `hotkey` attributes in `menubar.xml`).
  4. Write content for each section in clear, user-friendly language using Markdown formatting.
  5. Include screenshots of the new Qt6 UI where helpful (once UI tasks like `FINAL-04` are complete).
definition_of_done: |-
  A basic user manual in Markdown format (`UserManual.md`) is created.
  Key requirements:
  - Covers application installation for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  - Provides a tour of the new Qt6 UI, explaining major components (main window, map view, palettes, toolbars).
  - Includes instructions for using core drawing and editing tools/features, based on the actual application menu structure derived from `menubar.xml`.
  - The manual is written clearly and is suitable for new users.
  - The Markdown is well-formatted.

  *This is a documentation task for a technical writer, not a direct coding task for a Coder AI.*

  **Task: Create Initial User Manual**

  **Input:**
  - Content of `menubar.xml` (defines user-facing menu structure, item names, hotkeys).
  - `wxwidgets/main_menubar.h` (for list of ActionIDs to cross-reference features).
  - General knowledge of the application's purpose (Tibia map editor).
  - UI/Feature descriptions from other completed WBS tasks (especially UI-xx, RENDER-xx, FINAL-xx). This task depends on `FINAL-04` for UI stability.

  **Output:**
  - A Markdown file (e.g., `UserManual.md`) containing the initial user manual.

  **Content Requirements:**
  1.  **Installation Guide:** Brief steps for Windows (MSI), macOS (DMG), Linux (.deb).
  2.  **UI Overview (Qt6 Version):**
      - Main window layout.
      - Menu bar and toolbars (reflecting structure from `menubar.xml`).
      - Map display area.
      - Key palettes (Brush, Item, Creature, House, etc.).
  3.  **Core Functionality Guide (based on features in `menubar.xml`):**
      - Creating, opening, saving maps.
      - Using different brush types for drawing.
      - Selecting and modifying map elements.
      - Using common tools (e.g., Find Item, Map Properties).
      - Navigating floors, zooming.
      - Key view options.
  4.  Use clear language and provide step-by-step instructions where appropriate.
  5.  Assume the user is new to the application.
  6.  The manual should be structured logically with clear headings.
  (Screenshots will be added later once the UI is stable).
